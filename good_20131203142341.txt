Sooo, how much life would you lose out of an engine if you use this?
Im guessing its effective as it creates more RPM in the cylinder, so surely 
it will kill an engine with regular use?
subbed﻿
##
When you are explaining the diagram, why do you have lots of text? It would 
be appreciative if you can make things understandable for a non engineer﻿
##
You forgot about purging your lines and you can use nitrous a numerous 
amount of times, it is not bad for your engine as long as your not crazy 
and try to shoot it with over a 100hp 
I started with a dry and I think every beginner should too its easy and you 
can do it your self and don't need to tune it as much as a wet system. 
Putting nitrous on a turbo car is good kills the lag from your turbo ") 
If your going to through a tank on your car make sure to do a full tune up 
of your car first then go with a dry kit and keep it at no more than 75 
shot/ HP ﻿
##
what would happen if you could inject clean oxygen O2 instead of air or NX?﻿
##
You refill the gas. Rate is like $3.50 a pound of N2O I think. The tank and 
system is expensive though.
##
on a Subaru STI when you put into Sport Sharp the throttle position sensor 
becomes waay more active than Sport or Intelligent Drive, meaning your foot 
could be down a quarter (don't quote me on the distance its been a while 
since subie school) of the way and it will tell the throttle to go wide 
open i would probably turn the arming with into a momentary because if you 
were drag racing and your throttle was wide open and spraying will standing 
it could be catastrophic. Just thinking outloud
##
How many times can you use it? Or ida it just one use and are they very 
expensive? Thanks
##
But it can be used in tons of stock applications. Most engines (V8) can 
handle 100 hp worth of nitrous with ease. 
##
very informative! You always explain everything in great detail in a way 
that is easy to understand! thank you! 
##
would you put a turbo 0n it then ever use nirtors with a tune to make up 
for lag? 
##
Why would you prefer dry?
##
Nice vid, really enjoying learning about engines
##
ya my H2B integra loves to get wet ;) awsome videos man.
##
It's an easy, fairly cheap way to make extra power, I think it's great 
depending on the application (drag racing). That said, I wouldn't install 
it on my car unless I built up the internals for it. 
##
What do you think is nitrous systeem good or bad for your engine and by the 
way i love your channel 
##
How cn v increase hp in an old car without spending too much on performance 
parts (on a budget)
##
great job at your explanations dude....... keep up the good work
##
Sure, that's what the activation button's for. You can have it set to open 
at WOT (when activated), or some have a switch to push to activate. Either 
way, you could activate at WOT for the same effect. 
##
is there a type of nos that u can do like fast and furious and deploy it as 
u wish
##
too soon junior...
##
wet system ? i prefer a dry :) good video !
##
I NEED NOS!
##
Thanks for your explanations. Nice channel
##
how does that system work for example on a turbocharged Diesel engine? (for 
example VW 1.9 TDI PD engine) it has to be much more diferent right?
##
Thank you for explaining that to me
##
To car or to human? It is dangerous to car because it stresses the engine 
as with every power increasing modification. Suddenly parts designed for 
200hp are forced to work at 300hp and that might lead to failiure of 
weakest parts. As with every power increase life of the engine will be 
shorter. And to human: It is an anesthetic, also know as laughing gas - You 
might suffocate or pass out from too high concentration of N2O, but 
otherwise it's harmless... And fun to inhale ;)
##
@engineering explained , i have a 4.6 3v gt mustang and ive been wanting to 
spray for a while but i always hear the spraying nos will mess up the rings 
and or heads.... can you explain this more? i want to be sure before i do 
anything. thank you 
##
Awesome vids!!
##
Yes, check out the NX website if you want to look at prices for your 
application. 
##
can you buy just the n2o? if there is already a kit and if so around what 
prices would ya say i'd be looking at? 
##
isn't there a direct injection tho? 
##
What differs between power shot systems and cams systems
##
intake manifold design should be taken into consideration when spraying 
nitrous on a plate setup. A fogger setup/direct wet nitrous injection is 
ideal for dry flow manifolds, which is common on most v8 fuel injection 
engines. Wet flow manifolds have long runners which distribute the nitrous 
more evenly and can be used for 200+ shots. Wet flow manifolds are similar 
to carburated manifolds.
##
wow man, yu re awesome,,,i love love love these clips,,, i can finally 
upgrade my knowledge right here...! cheers..btw you should become a 
professor at a college automotive department...! i hope you will be one day.
##
Is nitrous dangerous?? 
##
Might as well finish off the rings and bottom end with some nitrous :)
##
I like your channel coz its useful and the way to demonstrate a clear and 
excellent
##
i should have really paid more attention in math shouldn't I?
##
he went to school and listened 
##
do a vid of a 3rd gear pull with this on the leggy
##
very useful info. 
##
Thanks!
##
I love this channel!! Awesome videos bro I've watched them all and enjoy 
all of them.
##
Check out the FAQs on my "About" page on my channel. 
##
how do u know all this?
##
Yea i guess it would do more bad than good
##
It's a Mustang kit, so no haha. Besides my piston rings need replacement 
(as well as the rest of the bottom end) if that were to happen. 
##
Is this gonna go on your integra?
##
Hi great Chanel wanted to no if its not to much of a waste of time I have a 
toyota camry v6 with a 1mzfe engine and a nos kit and was wondering if you 
could provide a recommendation on a safe nos power setting for the stock 
engine thanks
##
danger to manifold
##
Depends on what type you have, but regardless it will be fairly 
instantaneous. 
##
Do those buttons that you press to activate n20 on the steering wheel 
activate straight away or is it controlled by the ECU?
##
I have to say, every video I've watched from this channel has explained 
everything perfectly and never left me on an unexplained cliff hanger. 
GREAT JOB!
##
supercharger's when pullied down can start to become inefficient. can 
Nitrous be used to gain efficiency that is lost because of the hotter air???
##
Getting a wet system should take care of the afr, however it's probably 
best to get a tune regardless. A dry system definitely requires tuning the 
afr. Probably beneficial to tune timing for both scenarios. 
##
They go out the exhaust with other expelled gases. Also, please only post 
your question once. 
##
Not if they're built for it. But if you're planning on spraying a 4 cyl 
with an additional 200 hp with stock components, yes it probably won't last 
too long. 
##
What happens to the lingering nitrogen atom once it breaks off from the 
oxygen atom?
##
Is this detrimental for engines?
##
Really amazing videos. I always learn something new in each video, lol. 
Keep it up
##
plan to installed one very soon..assuming now my car has reached it optimal 
power with prefect afr and ignition timing..do i need to fine tune the afr 
and ignition timing if installed it on my car..tq
##
Thank you for your fast reply, ill look in to getting it all done. see how 
much its going to cost etc. 
##
Thanks, love your country!
##
I wish my teachers explain as well as you do!! Greetings from spain!!
##
You also should say, that using N2O+fuel injection (over whatever is 
normally injected) increases EGT and that hurts your exhaust valves a LOT. 
Unless you use a rich mixture and waste all that fuel. But if you want run 
rich you can justify that and just add a turbo to the car - and have a 
power advantage each day, all day long :P In other words - N2O injection is 
pointless.
##
thanx buddy for your explanation with so much points.
##
Yes, you could feasibly install a system on practically any vehicle, you'd 
likely want to build up the engine a bit to handle the additional stresses. 
##
can these be used in any car, to give more overtaking power. and do you 
need any additional modifications to support nos. thank you 
##
Vivi en Espana por tres meses y estudie espanol en colegio. Lo siento para 
la puntuacion, mi teclado es muy simple.
##
Si no sabes español, por lo menos has logrado escribir como si lo 
conocieras. Felicitaciones, me gusta mucho tu canal.
##
Gracias, ojala que puedas entender! Tal vez en el futuro tendre "subtitles" 
de espanol. 
##
Muy buenos vídeos. Saludos desde Argentina...!!!
##
Awesome Video. Keep it up. I would just like to know where does the N2O 
recover from or does it ever get finished like you use up one bottle and 
then change it
##
Your entirely wrong about the dry nitrous system. Since the dry shot 
doesn't have it's own fuel source. The car's ecm must be recalibrated and 
tuned for a safe AFR. The car's ecm will not be able make the proper 
adjustments as you stated. What will actually happen is the car will go 
super lean and melt the pistons.
##
Correct, you have to adjust for it, which is why wet systems are typically 
the better option. 
##
Yo thx for making these vids life makes more sense after I watch UR vids 
plus u make everything so simple keep it up!
##
Haha let me do u whilst u bend over the bottle ;)
##
Can you do a clip on the main differences of hall effect and magnetic 
sensors please
##
Compression, and ignition. 
##
I don't believe it is corrosive, but my chemistry is poor. 
##
Love your videos!! Keep up the good work! 
##
Man. If you can explain it for a motorcycle. I'll be the luckiest man.
##
COOL man, i watched like 6 videos now, how are you so young and smart haha, 
keep it up bud ! educating the world one view at a time ! subscribed
##
But your floorboards will remain securely attached.
##
So, since the nitros is combined with the fuel. It needs 600 amount of 
temperature. To separate nitrous n fuel which is bonded together in order 
to combust them. Question is how do we get that amount of temperature? 
Change spark plug?
##
Is it true that the nitrous is corrosive and will eat away at your pistons 
and cylinder walls?
##
yeah 
##
Is posible to instal Nitrous Kit to a turbo diesel engine?
##
would it be safe to use nos on a day to day basis as long as its set low 
##
What are the after-effects due to N2O split, with respect to engine 
emissions?
##
Damn i didnt know you get so much hp off of nitrous!! Mad
##
dangur 2 manfold
##
you rock !
##
the brass jets are what people mean when they say 50 shot or 100 shot then? 
damn you learn something everyday
##
thanks man
##
Yes indeed!
##
If what you are referring to is the purging of nitrous before a run, it 
serves two purposes. First it primes the system by clearing the lines of 
atmosphere so that you don't have a lag when you engage the nitrous, the 
lines are full of the good stuff. Second, some people do this to bring the 
bottle pressure down to what the tuner wants it to be. They do this for 
consistency as the nitrous isn't regulated so a huge pressure difference 
can cause engine tuning issues.
##
1st great video and got much info covered about Nitrous. i got a question 
for you. can you set your nitrous intake control to gear shift? if you do 
that would it give more efficiency and less weariness?
##
Awesome video man! Very informative! I'm also watching this because I use 
nitrous in Need for Speed, and I really want to know how it works in real 
life.
##
Wow, this is so entertaining x)
##
That is called "purging." It's a technique used to clear the lines of any 
air that may have built up.
##
Cool...
##
Well.. I know its a movie.. but I wanna know about the button on 1st F&F 
movie, its like a "pulse" button, isn't ? Driver press it... then release 
it... later press again, and more power again... Is that the same system 
you explained here ?
##
This guy is brilliant!! His Geeky auto videos are interesting, informative 
and your diagrams and explanations are just so great to learn from. He 
deserves an award﻿
##
Can you please do a video thats shows and explains how would nitrous work 
for carburetor vehicles. Thanks
##
I just don't understand this obsession with "tuning" civics
##
0-55 shot for 4cyl 0-75 shot for 6 cyl and 0-150 for a v8, although you 
could do as big of a shot as you like on any engine but the chances of it 
lasting longer than a few shots is unlikely
##
Then you'll spray way too much fuel. 
##
When your full throttle does nos keep going in or does it only send a small 
shot of nos
##
very educative videos 
##
99 integra, and a sad little b18b1 underneath. This will change eventually! 
##
You have the best and most interesting channel on youtube! Thank you!!
##
what does wide open throttle mean? 
##
Check out the "automotive careers" link on my "about" page of my channel. 
It's a lengthy answer so I've linked there.
##
you sir, are fucking brilliant .Your videos are interesting, informative 
and your diagrams and explanations are just so great to learn from. You 
deserve an award my friend!!
##
So much simpler than I thought it would be. Please do water/methanol 
injection and maybe intercoolers in detail. Would like to hear your 
thoughts on water intercooler spray as well. Cheers!
##
Thanks, great to hear.
##
thanks for explaining the working clearly and it is easy to understand 
##
You'll have to find somewhere that fills N2O, yes, you have to pay for it.
##
save your money sell your shitbox buy an FRS
##
or even how wings and such impact downforce ( what downforce exactly is.. ) 
etc
##
Depends on the shot you run. The general rule is a 50 shot (wet) is safe on 
basically any car and there's no need to change timing. If you approach a 
100 shot, you need to kick back your ignition timing a couple degrees, and 
any more you need to retard by a degree each time you increase your shot by 
50hp. A stock block is usually safe around 100-150 but that ALL depends on 
the engine.
##
very nice explanation thank you 
##
Isnt is possible to get more than 200 hp if you used largest N2O jet and 
smallest fuel jet? 
##
Holy crap, it adds that much. Sheesh!
##
to get more hp frm turbos, u need to increase boost pressure. and to 
increase boost pressure to a high value, u need to get forged parts.... can 
any stock car get 200 more hp ?
##
Explain a bottle warmer
##
Y U NO USE METRIC???
##
Man I've been learning a lot reading in mags and online but sometimes its 
alittle cconfusing its mutch easier having stuff explained
##
Man I learn a lot from you.. Thanx and keep posting
##
what does that mean? you're lucky that hundred shot of nos didn't blow your 
welds on the intake?
##
so what does the nitrogen do if the oxygen splits and combusts in the 
combustion chamber? 
##
Cuz dis is murica 
##
usually around 55 but you could go higher, but at that point you are 
putting long life and reliability on the line, if its a built 4cyl engine 
with say 10k in the engine you could probably do a 200 shot
##
If a quick car is your only goal, $25k can go a lot farther than an FRS. 
Though I do love those cars.
##
Bottles are for babies and its extreme on internal engine parts.
##
You should use NOS its better than nitrous express
##
There are chipsets you can use that will increase your hp. You can also 
raise your compression ratio a little to generate more power per srtoke and 
delay your ignition to have the piston move downwards with higher force, 
thus generating more power. You can still increase your turbo pressure a 
little without changing any parts. Also reducing your car's weight is a 
good way to increase your hp/lb ratio which is good, Of course all of this 
will shorten your parts longevity.
##
If you dont mind me asking what car do you drive? and whats under the hood? 
you seem to have alot of knowledge about this stuff
##
I've got videos on turbos, search my channel or check out my forced 
induction playlist. Cheers
##
just curious, where do you find reliable sources? thanks :)
##
hi i cannot use air filter in my bike bcz its losing throttle after half 
turn sometimes before half and at full throttle it stutters
##
I have learnt so much spending an hour or two watching your videos. Great 
job. everything is explained very clearly.
##
You should make a video to explain Direct port Nitrous injection!
##
I suppose it depends, but perhaps not. If the diesel typically injects 
multiple shots of diesel, it may not work the same, but maybe it could be 
altered. Regardless, concentrated O2 is a bit dangerous, as it reacts very 
quickly with a flame source, where as N2O is a bit more safe. 
##
Well if you're going for the most power it could be done with either form 
of forced induction (and the many options within). You'll want good tires 
as well. 
##
Good video; I just will never use NOS in any of my track cars. It ruins the 
engine from the inside out and it stinks when your flying down the track...
##
Yes, it can be activated by a button/switch. Probably doesn't have to be at 
WOT in this case, but why would you not be at WOT and use nitrous? Purging 
is done to remove any gas from the line, so that right up until the 
injection point the line is filled with liquid. 
##
F&F <3
##
Why is it that some systems have to spray the nitrous before it's used? How 
is this done?
##
Hey I'm in the same boat, learning mostly from online (and Forza is great 
too). Glad to help you learn!
##
Man thanks ^~^ now i know how it works
##
Glad you like it!
##
My current ccar I'm interested in is the Subaru WRX
##
i see, well the reason i'm asking this is because i tried releasing some 
pure oxygen into an older engine (carubrator) and it's idle revs went up 
for about 1000rpm more than normal, and since oxygen helps with the fuel 
combustion, i believe it's logical that if the ignition timing is set 
right, it would also bring up the HP of the car, and it's cheaper than 
NOS.... 
##
You have the best channel on YouTube, period.
##
Do they say that? Haha something tells me your F250 wasn't meant for 
racing. Diesels are definitely something I need to dive deeper into at some 
point. 
##
does nitrous shorten engines life?
##
So, Nitrous is used to increase the ammount of oxygen in the engine, which 
allows you to increase the ammount of fuel you can burn. Overall you get 
better HP, but can you use better quality or a different kind of fuel to 
increase HP? I would like to see you cover something on this topic. Did a 
quick search on wikipedia for "nitro" and it showed nitrometane as a 
high-preformance fuel. This is all fascinating for me, I know nothing about 
engines and you explain everything really well. Great job!
##
99 integra
##
What would be the difference if I use pure oxygen bottle (like the one from 
the co2 welding apparatus) instead of NOS ? 
##
Do you know what's the difference between this system where the button is 
actually a system switch for on/off, and the fast-and-furious 2 button 
setup? Or is the two buttons setup just a lack of knowledge from movie 
writers just as the "double clutching" in F&F 1?
##
ok dude :) 
##
or do you mean how long a tank will last on a 4cyl, if thats what you are 
asking, you could probably get around 12-16 10 second shots if its a 55 
shot and using a 10 lb bottle
##
What's a safe amount to run on this set up with a car that has 400 Hp so 
when it hit it does blow anything even over many uses
##
How do you know this ?! THANK YOU SO MUCH ! you somehow figure out a way to 
explain such complex things in fantastic details, so simply. Thank you !
##
I really like to watch your videos, I am a car enthusiast and almost all my 
questions are answered by you. I'm also a Mechanical Eng'g student in our 
local area.
##
Wrong. Nitrous won't cause flames and there are no additives other than 
sulfur for detecting leaks (scent). They aren't running lean (or they would 
blow the engine quickly) and they aren't running rich enough to shoot 
flames. Flames are strictly from antilag/timing settings or excess oil/fuel 
making it out into the exhaust in many different possible ways. Don't post 
things if you don't know what you're talking about haha no point misleading 
people.
##
My brain continues to grow! 
##
Can you make a video on the LFX engine?
##
the movies have a special additive on the NOS system to do that. Normally 
you wont ever see that. Your ECU will compensate either by leaning the fuel 
or riching it up pending on what it sees by your O2 sensors.
##
They have universal kits, this is a specific kit for a Mustang, but they 
would have kits that could work with your car. 
##
I get how the nitrous is injected when it the gas is at full throttle, but 
is their like a button or lever that can activate the system when you want 
the nitrous to be injected? Like in the movies on the steering wheel. Also, 
does nitrous have to be injected at full throttle? Lastly, what is purging 
the nitrous lines? Thanks! :)
##
Yeah I'm only kidding. It's quick for a truck. Its basically a diesel 
version of the raptor. I need to upload some videos
##
It's there to prevent pre-detonation intially, and serves as a molecule to 
store the oxygen with. 
##
Good work man! I watch all your videos.. keep it up!
##
Correct mixture YES but you'll need to retard your timing when spraying.
##
I suppose you could call NX and see what they think. 
##
Well, you can't just add 200 HP to your engine right without something 
breaking right? You'd have to mod your engine somehow to handle all those 
extra ponies? 
##
Yeah, that would literally DOUBLE the output of my GTI.
##
nitrous oxide injection only lasts for a few seconds, you don't need to 
modify your engine..
##
I hear ya. I know I don't have anything related to cars on my channel. I 
mainly just watch and comment with this account (only one I have). But I am 
not a big fan of drag racing. Huge though with rally/drift and some touring 
car racing. I have a long way to go in the industry but I am willing to do 
what's necessary. Good to meet you though and get some info on something I 
know little of. I also think the movies portray N2O the wrong way like The 
Fast and The Furious movies.
##
It's based off of what I have learned from people who have used it. I 
personally will never touch nitrous for my track cars. I will how ever us 
liquid nitrogen connected to tiny nozzles at the inter-cooler, radiator, 
and oil cooler to help the engine perform much better. Have you used 
nitrous? and if so, what do you think the pro's and con's are? would love 
to hear your opinion on it. I like talking shop with fellow gear heads :)
##
How do you refill your n2o can? Do you have to pay for it, or just like 
need for speed they fill up automatically?! LOL
##
Haha we still have 2 liter bottles, which is common in stores. But if you 
were to ask someone to translate that in gallons, they probably wouldn't 
know. Our unit system is broken. 
##
I'll accept your comment as an award, thank you sir!
##
Likely, yes. This system is specifically for the Coyote 5.0L.
##
Great video. 
##
even with 10k under the hood there is always room for 100-200 more hp
##
is it possible to put nitrous in a stock 95' nissan altima?
##
As you use nitrous, it lowers the bottle pressure (optimal is 1000-1050psi) 
therefore a bottle warmer will: a.) quickly warm up the nitrous to the 
desired pressure before a race b.) keep the pressure steady as you use it 
up.
##
There's not really an answer to this question. Just depends how overbuilt 
your engine is I suppose. If an engine is optimized for it's power (which 
properly engineered engines will likely be), and has a low factor of safety 
for stresses, then 200 extra hp could do a great deal of damage. Just 
depends.
##
just make sure you dont blow the welds on the intake, or else you'll have 
to replace the piston rings as well
##
Wouldn't work for many many reasons. To keep nitrous liquid it needs to be 
in a pressurized container, any area that isn't liquid (space) will be 
gaseous nitrous. The two liquids will have different densities (they likely 
won't just mix). Could get gaseous nitrous in your fuel line...
##
Do you have a video haha?
##
Direct port dry shot is how us ghetto ppl do it. Haha, its actually just 
the quick and easy way. I just drilled a hole into my intake, ran the hose 
to it, hit the button, and viola! Easy peezy lemon squeezey!
##
ya iv got a question can one mix hydrogen peroxide commercial disinfectant 
to gasoline and get extra boost or power ?
##
Could you do a video on meth injection?
##
Wonderful explanation .. your really specific in information .. what kind 
of studies do i have to study to work in this type of engineering system .. 
mechanical engineering or Just Car engineering ?
##
What is the standard volume of N2O per shot in the 4cyl?
##
can you use nitro on a diesel engine? 
##
How old are you?
##
Like purging the nitrous system before use! 
##
Any side effects? 
##
I believe so yes.
##
How much did that nitrous oxide system cost?
##
@EngineeringExplained Thanks, I'am a first year apprentice mechanic working 
for Nissan Australia. Your channel has helped me learn so many things and 
has given me a much better understanding of cars :)
##
QUESTION: Knowing that the system only works when going full throttle, does 
it stop when full throttle is released? More specifically, What happens if 
you're driving a manual and you have to change gears? Does the Nitrous keep 
going until empty regardless or does it switch off once open throttle is 
released? 
##
get that baby fitted to your Integra :P
##
And greetings from germany! Your channel is awesome. As an engineering 
student myself I love watching your vids
##
My advice would be to find out what they can really handle, and go from 
there. Never hurts to overcompensate for better reliability. 
##
u have to pull mad skids, then the nitrous fairy comes and fills it
##
Correct!! Oxygen is far more combustible at pure form; it's often 
surprising how quickly it can expand with just heat added alone and it 
doesn't combust The Nitrogen acts as a mitigant for the Oxygen so to 
control the precise amount of combustion you need in the given system. 
##
How likely is adding 200 extra hp, even shortly, to damage your engine?
##
I don't know how overbuilt engines are, but there probably are some out 
there that could handle it, at least for a while. I certainly wouldn't 
trust my own car with an extra 200 hp with no modifications. 
##
which one is that? one for a civic hatchback.
##
Fuel types is a good idea of a topic to cover, good suggestion. 
##
its quite obvious you arent in north america, there is some 600-1000+ hp 
street cars 
##
Why isn't pure Oxygen injected?
##
Sounds good man. At least you're working towards it, it's annoying when 
people with no clue come on these comments and bash things they don't 
understand haha. You should look into a 50 shot for drag racing, you'll 
learn quickly when you do the build (takes 2 days at most). And 50 is very 
safe.
##
Do they make tb plates to fit all vehicles? How do you know how much you 
can safely run?
##
hes saying that much nitrous would blow your welds on your intake
##
So how does it destroy an engine over multiple uses?
##
Thank you for taking the time too make this video. Very informative.
##
i have a stupid question: in real life,when you use nitrous,do flames come 
out of the muffler like in need for speed or the fast and the furious??
##
I have that on the to do list. That said, the to do list is quite long. I'm 
hoping to eventually have a "quick lessons" playlist which has topics like 
this, which take relatively shorter amounts of time to explain. 
##
what car do you drive? by the way your videos are great. keep them coming! 
##
Thanks for this great video, question.... When installing a Nitrous kit 
what are the critical adjustments and conversions must you do to your 
engine so you don't destroy it? Thanks.
##
Thanks for the explain. I learn something. Keep up the good work!
##
I like how you put the power of the corvette in context. What is a sports 
car without comparison. Compared to several other automakers the corvette 
pwr plant us unimpressive & sad to say behind the times tech wise. I'd like 
to see GM put their best foot forward but they seem too hung up on 
tradition. Porches Honda/Acura seem to easily extract more HP/Ltr. What's 
with that.
##
Thanks! Your name is extraordinarily long!
##
In my visit to Cuba I discover that many cars were "costumized" with disel 
engines just to save $on fuel. 
##
welcome to sheldon cooper presents fun with flags =D
##
If you do a vid on a wet/dry fogger you might want to get the NOS brand of 
nitrous
##
It doesn't hurt to build up the engine a bit. 
##
Probably a stupid question but, FRS?
##
Whatever the weakest components are (pistons, rods, crank, etc.). I know 
that's a blanket statement but it varies from engine to engine. Some 
manufacturers use high factors of safety for their components than others - 
and typically they'll cost more. Just depends on how good your internals 
are. I'd recommend reading up on forums of what other people have had 
success with with your engine. 
##
Well explained! I can see your hard work! Well done :)
##
the gallon is broken down into quarts, pints, cups and ounces. drinks in a 
bottle are usually in metric-1 liter (yeah, we have to spell everything 
differently) or 2 liter, or 500 or 750 milliliter, OR 12, 16, or 20 ounce 
(oz) bottles. there is no standard. your example doesn't translate to any 
size...about 11 ounces. A foot is an official measurement because it is 
about the length of an adult male foot. and 12 (inches) breaks down well, 
6, 4, 3, and 2. calenders, clocks, inches all use 12.
##
I would contact NX to find fittings, they have universal kits. And it's 
hard to know how much you can safely run, but they may be able to provide 
insight there as well. 
##
Glad you think so, thanks!
##
Umm no this is the internet.did you know that there a are other countries 
in the world? and did you know that they have internet? I dont understand 
you people. how can a foot be a official measurement unit? and how do you 
buy drinks? are they 0.0871 gallons?
##
How do they calculate the power gains for the n2o system? It doesn't vary 
from motor to motor?
##
At lower temperatures, air is more dense, hence it has more oxygen by 
volume - that's the idea of creating more power with the same volume of 
air. It assumes the percentage of oxygen in air is constant, but there's 
more when air is more dense.
##
Very welcome!
##
can stock pistons take N2O? i heard my stock pistons are designed for max 
120horses. now i have about 100horses... need your advice...
##
What would you recommend for a racing car that would own. What is the 
fastest? All Motor, Turbocharged, or Superchared?
##
how does purge work ?
##
Well I just check many many sources, and try to pick out what information 
seems logical. If it's been repeated enough, and seems logical, it has a 
decent chance of being accurate. Though my videos aren't without errors, of 
course.
##
Very good. Classroom type learning instead of redneck nitrous backfire at 
the track :)
##
Increasing temps and pressures has this effect, yes. 
##
Very interesting and informal videos, thanks!
##
can you plz explain how quadrajet carburetor works 
##
Is it possible for a car to explode the way it was shown in Fast and the 
Furious 1, eclipse scene? Nice video, it's great how this company gave you 
resources to make your videos even richer. Best regards. 
##
Can you please explain twin scroll turbos or variable turbine geometry in a 
future video? 
##
My question what is the timming of the vehicle has changed and dp u add 
more timing or less. And also please explain why its important to also 
check the temp of your plugs when using n2o
##
Very informative channel keep up the good work! I was just wondering, I 
know this is old school but did you ever have any experience with the 
Oldsmobile 350 diesel engine? I am an old car buff and I always thought it 
was an interesting concept GM had. Putting diesel engines in full size cars 
in order to give them more "power" and decent fuel economy. Despite 
disastrous mechanical faults. I was just wondering if you ever heard of or 
dealt with these engines and what your thoughts were on them.
##
Yeah just cover anything electrical. I covered a few connections, my 
battery, and alternator and washed the burnt oil off my engine not too long 
ago. It was fine, but I've heard many horror stories so be careful. 
##
The 2011 engine is honestly quite a device. To anyone in the used car 
market thinking of buying a Mustang, put that into your consideration. Not 
impressed with any of the engines prior to 2011. 
##
Did anybody else upon first glance think it was a penis on the board behind 
him? No offense intended EE, I love your videos, I just found it humorous 
haha.
##
Hi EngineeringExplained, my engine bay is kinda dirty after a salty winter. 
And i want to clean it, do i need to cover up anything when spray soap and 
water on it? thanks in advance!
##
O2 cannot combust without a fuel, it's not a flammable gas but it is 
required for combustion to occur. If more oxygen is present, nearly 
anything around it can suddenly act as fuel. 
##
I searched a lot but cant find please help me to know about fuel injection 
in petrol{SI}(not CI)engines,,,,,, i am from India and the bike having it 
is pulsar 220 dtsfi kindly reply me in a way that i can 
understand.......... By the way i have watched almost all your videos they 
really have stuff in them 
##
I have goals of doing so before my final days :)
##
does this type of fuel system applicable for bikes.and racing cars.... 
##
Since your done can I has that kit?
##
NO. Oxygen is not flammable. The flammable is the CH4 which is the fuel. 
The fuel need Oxygen to change state. From CH4 plus O will turn to CO2, H2O 
and heat. the rocketships uses H2 and O to form H2O and this still cause 
heat to create and still pushes the rocketships fly. basely the heat is the 
one that cause the rocketships to fly.
##
So I greatly appreciate the break down in these systems, and look forward 
to seeing your other videos. I am an EE, so these systems are a bit 
foreign, but I do not think they are beyond my grasp. So QA time. What is 
the risk to overflowing the NOs? Are you looking at overheat, and cylinder 
explosion? Is that the reason for the different intake nozzles? Is it so 
you can help control the inevitable damage that you will be doing? Or are 
current cylinders typically designed with this in mind?
##
i have Nitrous in my Pontiac Grand Prix GTP. and ive put over 25 bottles 
through my car and with a good safe setup and you know what your doing its 
a GREAT power adder!
##
Backfires are more likely to happen in 2 instances...1. morons that don't 
use WOT switch and 2. dry kits. On a dry kit you are relying on your MAF to 
make SURE your injectors send more fuel. Either instance, too much N20 and 
not enough fuel=boom boom. Hope that helped.
##
No I didn't, I just thought back to what you'd said about it while watching 
this one.I debated my bro where I'd claimed that European performance 
vehicles have more HP/LT. than GM performance vehicles. The pwr that a 
Porsche or BMW can extract per liter is outstanding. I also have a Z1000 
kawaski & it puts out about 130+hp. That's a whole other can of worms. I 
can talk aboutthis stuff all day. Or listen. 
##
Flooring it, the throttle is fully open.
##
Haven't heard of this model, no. But I am aware of the days during the 
70s/80s when the big American companies thought it was a decent idea to 
swap fuel delivery systems on gas engines to diesels without much work on 
the internals, resulting in terrible diesel engines. Probably played a big 
role in why so many Americans just avoid diesels. They're much more 
efficient engines. 
##
I've heard that Nitrous is bad for your engine. Some people have said that 
it will pretty much destroy your piston. Is this true? Or does it depend on 
your setup??
##
nah you get more than one shot out of a bottle. Depends how long you spray 
the juice for haha. 
##
r u gonna put that kit in ur Integra?
##
It's a shaft that is on the bottom of your car and it connect to the 
transmission then to either a transfer case and or differential. If ur car 
is a front wheel drive it won't have it
##
what about a video on "chirping to 2nd, 3rd, and the rare 4th gear" I have 
an idea as to what it is but not sure how/why it happens not to mention 
that I've heard it is bad for the clutch.
##
At wide open throttle the car is in open loop and will (in most systems) 
ignore the O2 sensor. In a standalone system, you can add extra pulse width 
to your injectors during ( WOT && nitrous system on)
##
yes, search my channel for diesel vs gas
##
Yes. Thank you so much for responding! :)
##
Good guy NX :D
##
Great vid. Can you also discuss nitrous systems being used to spray 
intercoolers?
##
I was hoping in the video you would have discussed the trade-offs with 
having nitrous such as the potential damage and increased wear you can put 
on your engine. 
##
Great vid as always! Thanks a lot
##
Love the videos, so much detail. makes me wanna go to school to become a 
engineer.
##
They say that the rate of pressure/heat rise when using N2O is higher than 
when using forced induction (resulting in increased bearing wear). Why is 
this?. 
##
Your like, so smart
##
Haha, you've found a great channel for accomplishing that! Thanks for 
subscribing!
##
so bro you are asking about gasoline direct injection engine. actually in 
GDI a special type of injector inject petrol under high pressure about 2000 
psi directly into the combustion chamber rather than the intake manifold. 
here common rail fuel injection system is used and the fuel is injected 
during the suction stroke at an angle 60 degree of the crank travel after 
TDC.
##
Worse, because the nitrogen prevents the oxygen from igniting too early 
(before the spark) from compression. 
##
Probably would have pre-ignition.
##
I really hope to see a video why nitrous would be dangerous to an engine.
##
I'm pretty set on the STI; should have one within the next couple years. 
##
I suppose so. it'd be similar to installing directly to each intake port 
(which you could also do).
##
a 200 horse power increase in an engine that produces less than 200 is an 
easy way to destroy it, right?
##
A few quick points: -Most ems' and very late model advanced ECMs *can* do 
closed loop fuel control at wide open but 99% of ecms and aftermarket ems' 
will NOT do closed loop at wide open throttle. they're running off of 
pre-tuned maps for fuel/spark tables which is "open loop" and must be tuned 
accordingly. -most n2o kits on efi motors are injected via a single nozzle 
before the throttle body. the high velocity n2o hits the fuel stream and 
atomizes it so you get a fuel/n2o fog
##
Assuming it was designed to handle less than 200 hp, yes. 
##
So are you going to put that on your Acura? And @christails he has made a 
video for that, and it is a good one!
##
@sillystring: I think it will stop injecting once you release throttle 
because the sensor ist the only information (except the position of the 
switch) your system gets. Therefore the injectors wont get any power supply.
##
nos always appealed to me but ive feared blowing up an engine with the 
system. Id love to have it in street applications but it seems like id get 
in too much trouble with it...
##
can you do a video explaining HP/Torque and RPM graphs or curves?? thanks!
##
*parts, not videos
##
i know it looks cool =D especially when coming out of the nose of a Skyline 
*cough*Brian*cough*
##
Really good video. I had no idea or interest in how an engine worked, then 
I watched one of your videos. I'm hooked. You explain it so well. Thanks
##
There is quite a few actually. Simplest one probably being : If you want 
too much horsepower (basically : to much pushing on your cylinders) you are 
going to blow up your engine. But that probably doesn't happen much. Mostly 
the problem will be that your fuel system will need to be able to supply 
the amount of fuel that you are asking.. If it cant you will run "lean" and 
this is bad for your engine. Really bad.
##
Bravo sir! keep them coming! 
##
I agree! It'd be great if more companies would send me videos for 
educational purposes; many thanks to Nitrous Express! 
##
I had no intentions of installing it on my own car. We discussed which kit 
would be best for a video and this is what we ended up choosing. 
##
I'm sure it varies by state as far as having it active while on the street. 
##
Is nitrous legal in America?
##
Land of the free!
##
Hey I know this is probably a dumb question but I really wanna know, what 
strand of study did you go into university for. I'm 15 and I really wanna 
do the same thing. Btw amazing videos they just keep getting better and 
better :)
##
So would this system be fairly similar on a carburetor? 
##
It would be great if you would do more videos like this where you get to 
show us the parts and how they work! Love your videos!
##
Hey, i have a doubt... a turbo works in a slimier manner right? i.e. it 
lets in cold air into the cylinders so it will produce more power... so can 
i install a nitros kit into a diesel engine which is turbo charged? will i 
need to replace any parts of the engine like, intake manifold?
##
The system I showed would be very similar, yes. Replace every time I say 
"throttle body" with "carburetor" and the video would basically explain it. 
##
Thanks, that explains a lot. Also, you should explain methanol injection. 
Or is it methane? Whichever one it is, I can't remember but you probably 
know what I mean.
##
Can you please do a video about wheel spin? I always hear F1 commentators 
talking about it but I don't understand what it is. If you could, I'd 
really appreciate it! I love the channel, by the way. :)
##
Your videos are awesome and I appreciate you taking the time to make them. 
I am a car guy and a gear head. Sure I admit most of my knowledge comes 
from research online, Forza Motorsport :) and car meets. I have applied 
your videos to the cars I've had : 98 Celica, 99 BMW 323i , and Ford 
explorer sport trac. Its awesome to see things and get a better hands on 
explanation. Thanks man!
##
Would it blow a stock 5.0 in a manual mustang?
##
The one with the most power and best traction. 
##
Hi, thanks for the video. Is it possible to run NOS on diesel cars like 
VW/Audi TDI models?
##
This was great & informative. I have a 2011 mustang & it's nice to see from 
your description than the engine was made with nitrous in mind. I stretched 
for that one.
##
It's totally legit, because you can decide between using a WOT or a Push 
Button to activate it. 
##
sooo does nitrous lower your engine's life expectancy?
##
How long would a tank of nitrous that big last for? And just to make sure 
is the nitrous being used only when a button is pressed like in the movies 
or is it constantly being used during driving unless its armed off? Thanks 
and keep up with the videos!
##
NX offers nitrous controllers that will monitor TPS signal and the 
controllers are programmable to start bringing nitrous in at lower TPS 
values. If you have no way of monitoring the throttle position (such as 
with a controller) there is really no good consistent way to do it. You can 
put it on a push button like you see in most movies, that is always an 
option.
##
would work untill you run out of n2o and then you would over heat 
##
Swap out the camshaft for a new one, with higher lift and/or higher 
duration. I should have a video up eventually. 
##
yes.
##
Our systems start at $399 
##
Please explain how he Vortec engine works?
##
Reminds me of the old The Fast And The Furious :)
##
So basically, Nitrous are more efficient than turbo/superchargers because 
you can control when you want extra horsepower and you can also control how 
much added horsepower you want? The only negative will be running cost 
(having to buy a new nitrous bottle when the old one runs out of nitrous)??
##
@EngineeringExplained so bring it to my house ill ghetto it up so it'll 
work without extra parts
##
more hp = higher cylinder pressure and temp
##
can you please make a vid about nitrous purge,what is it how does it 
work,what it does? thanks!
##
why would anyone want to use the smaller nozzles? is there any 
disadvantages to the big ones versus the small ones? other than the level 
of hp
##
Perhaps he's thinking in terms of efficiency. Could nitrous injection at 
lower revs give your motor more miles per gallon? I imagine the Nitrous 
Oxide tank itself would have to be larger, and you would probably be 
spending more money on N2O than you would for just gasoline, but would 
overall efficiency of the engine increase?
##
Since the fuel and nitrous systems are now working together and fixing the 
ratios of the two liquids being sprayed instantaneously, does that mean the 
engine won't run properly when you run out of nitrous? It doesn't really 
sound practical to have to have some NO2 just to make your car go 
(especially if the system uses more NO2 than fuel due to the larger 
nozzle). Can you shine some light on this Jason? 
##
dude ur from which country becoz ur simply super.........?
##
Purge kits were designed to relive the pressure in the bottle to get it 
back to optimal operating pressure, as well as to purge any air from the 
lines. Plus it looks cool! :) 
##
No worries, I am an auto tech in training. So I am still learning. My 
eventual goal is to be on a pit crew with either a rally team or drift team 
plus being a ASE certified master technician. So if someone knows more then 
me I am all ear's to learning! I just love automotive mechanics.
##
Would adding a pure oxygen system be better than nitrous?? Having the same 
set up but instead of nitrous have pure oxygen.. Would that be better or 
worse?
##
dude why are you on youtube you should be working on advance cars right now!
##
I'm well aware, but petrol and diesel costs almost twice as much as it does 
over there, add taxes and maintenance costs on top of that plus the high 
price of cars and te economic situation altogether and the last thing you'd 
want would be serving gasoline to a dinasaur ;) We have more than a few 
diesel cars reaching 180mph with 300hp or just a bit more, and that's with 
a 2.0l 4cyl.
##
Can you make a video on turbo? Or turbo systems? I would like to learn more 
about turbo :) I think you had a post saying you might do one turbo vs 
supercharger.
##
I likee and appreciate you videos. Very educational. I looked at videos 
that you already posted but did not see any regarding e85 fuel. Can make a 
video about e85 fuel please. Thanks.
##
I believe you can set the duration, and this can last up to 10 seconds or 
so.
##
Just some additional notes: Most EMS's don't use O2 feedback for the level 
of fuel correction in a dry kit - it's too much of a correction and it 
could be too late for your motor to even correct if it relied on it, it 
typically has to use a modified or different EMS, but most EMS's (even 
stock) aren't even running closed loop at WOT. The EMS has to be made aware 
of nitrous. You can use triggers and the GIO pins on most standalone units.
##
nice hair cut
##
Likely would cause knock. 
##
Nitrous: One of the greatest Invention of all time. ps. did you install the 
kit on your car, if so how do you like it? btw, awesome video as usual.
##
Yes, you'd probably want to replace some internals. 
##
what are the dangers of a nitrous system? 
##
Are you going to put that Nitrous on your car?
##
Yes, it is, but mostly the type R for it's incredible chassis. Not sure 
what the differences are chassis-wise between it and my ls. 
##
Will feeding the Air Intake with pure Oxygen (say from an Oxygen cylinder) 
do anything?﻿
##
why dont you do an integra 'engineering explained' video? isnt it one if 
the most beloved fwd cars?
##
could you explain what a nitrous purge system does and why it they exist? I 
would appreciate any expansion on this topic. I am a huge fan of your 
videos, you do a great job explaining things.
##
On cars using intercoolers to cool charge air, do you think this negates 
the need for an intercooler? I see many dragsters run nitrous without 
intercoolers. I guess less piping means less lag, also probably lighter....
##
Can you explain the meaning of "cammed" please and thanks
##
not only that: pur oxygen would be dangerous, a leak would be a serious 
treat of fire. Also, pur oxygen would not remain liquid in the line between 
trunk and motor, which means liquid nitrous contains more oxygen than pur 
oxygen in its gas state. Not 100% sure about that last claim, it still 
makes sense from a theorical POV.
##
It's for a Mustang, I drive an integra. I'd need some extra parts. 
##
Thermodynamic. Take water for example, you should already know you need 
some heat to boil it. It takes some energy to increase temperature up to 
the boiling point, then it takes even more energy to make a state 
transition (liquid to gas). That transition requires a lot of energy. If 
you have something that can evaporate easily (nirous), it will drain heat 
from the surrounding area, thus creating the "cool" effect. Long story 
short, evaporation needs energy and will drain it from wherever it can.
##
Before I believe. 
##
No, it's a kit for the Coyote 5.0. Thanks! 
##
I'd say none: if you can trick your ECU easily, go dry. If not, you need a 
new secondary gas line, which can be tricky to install.
##
Great video!
##
I believe the nitrogen aids in preventing the oxygen from detonating with 
the fuel before the spark. 
##
Yes but for a street car I would be happy with 200hp. Most cars in Europe 
now kick around 200hp and a bit more with 2.0l engines. Diesel engines here 
even get around 300Nm so it's good fun. As I said, we pay higher taxes and 
even more based on the emission's and engine displacement. Plus, if you 
want to have it street legal, you can't make big mods on your car because 
it wouldn't be aproved. The ones that do, only take their cars out for 
racing or have friends in the inspection center :P
##
So, what happens to the nitrogen atoms after they split? Do they do 
anything?
##
NAWSSSSSSS!!!!!!
##
No its not. Nitous Express/Dynotune/NOS are equally good and have different 
product types. ZEX is the ricey one that bases HP shots off of the crank 
and not the wheels
##
Wow you are so smart
##
Find me a position that doesn't require research on the side. :)
##
I've checked out the site a bit, kits seem to range from about $500-$1000. 
I suppose how long it lasts depends on your internals and how well you 
maintain a proper air/fuel ratio. 
##
How long will one "Nitrous bottle" take to get empty? Like 5 accelerations? 
:D
##
You could, yes, but why would you want to? I guess the logic is, if you're 
going to use nitrous, you want to accelerate quickly. If you want to 
accelerate quickly, you probably have the throttle fully open (gas pedal 
floored). Otherwise you may only make as much power as you would just 
flooring it, so it wouldn't be necessary. 
##
I would say wet since the A/F ratio can be more easily maintained. 
##
Because Nitrogen supresses the likely hood of the air fuel mixture to 
pre-detonate or knock. Having pure oxygen would likely cause the mixture to 
knock before the spark fired. 
##
Great video dude! Keep it up!
##
What other mods do u need to support nitrous? I'm guessing a air−fuel gauge 
to start with. Another good vid man thanks for the education.
##
Super video. Bravo!
##
This is actually really interesting.. and very well explained! So I guess 
the air temperature sensor wouldn't even be needed anymore, because it goes 
from just above normal atmospheric temp, to -127 F to 600+ F i guess once 
it ignites. Thats amazing.
##
which is best dry or wet?
##
Well, the nitrous cools to -127, but that doesn't mean the entire air/fuel 
mixture will drop that low, maybe 50-75 degrees cooler. Also, the 600 F 
would be inside the cylinder, so not measured by an ATS. Glad you enjoyed 
the video, thanks for watching!
##
Your videos are amazingly clear.... you should teach in a college =D
##
I bet that old civic of your kicking ass on that 1320
##
That is very interesting! 
##
87, in my prime! 
##
Woah, thanks!
##
What if you only put the jet in the fuel line? Wouldn't it just be an 
unadulterated amount of N2O?
##
im not sure how these systems work, the PSI is 50 at the output? each 
cylinder has an injector at 24-30K psi of fuel so how would one integrate 
this?
##
Correct. 
##
Would that still be a problem with diesel engines? Great channel btw.
##
Thank you!
##
PS: Very nice explanation, though :).
##
Hey dude, awesome video! one question I have a 2.0 1995 WRX impreza and 
looking to install a supercharger and nitro kit, what sort of 
considerations should I take before installing i.e. planning stage?
##
He said in the video it joins just before the fuel rail.
##
Great video keep up the good work man. 
##
That is a splice to send fuel to the N20 Plate and the fuel rail. It is not 
a line that goes to the tank, it uses the standard line from the tank and 
then splices in the engine bay (easier to install).
##
Do you have a video on 4 wheel steering ? I heard the new 911 gt3 has it 
and I wanted to understand how that works
##
Nitrous is the "sleeping gas" right? When I got my wisdom teeth removed it 
made me feel all light and tingly, it was fun.
##
How old are if you don't mind me asking? You look in 20's but your hair is 
showing some grey areas
##
Breath it! Trust me, I'm in med school!
##
Is that gas line run to the tank or would you run it to a second fuel cell 
with say racing fuel with a higher octanefor instance?
##
so, why not simply use cryo LOx?, pure oxygen injected would yield an 
enormous ammount of boost without leaving 2 free N atoms that will form 
extra NO contamination for the cat converter, plus it boils at -190C so 
even more cooler and more charge
##
awesome video, how much do those kits cost and how many times can you use 
it before you blow your gasket, head or the block?
##
I didn't really discuss pros and cons, you're right. Benefits include more 
power for a cheap price. Of course, if your engine can't handle the 
additional pressure/stress, you'll need better internals (goes for any 
modification). The danger with nitrous oxide comes from improper air/fuel 
ratios, which can damage the engine. If the air/fuel mixtures are kept at 
ideal levels, there's no reason why it can't be reliable. That said, it's 
better for short bursts of power, rather than long track days. 
##
Wheel spin, as in losing traction? 
##
It's when there's detonation that occurs not only from the spark, but 
elsewhere in the cylinder. Not a desirable thing to have happen. 
##
you should make a video of haw to spray safely, and haw to avoid damage on 
engines when sprayng.. 
##
Thx - keep up the good vids man!
##
That's a quote from the late Carroll Shelby.
##
Why did you have a kit for a Ford engine if you drive a Acura? Just 
wondering.
##
Is the fuel pressure regulator before or aftere the T going to nos spacer
##
What if you don't put the brass jets into the fuel line?
##
Doesn't nitrous fuck up the engine? 
##
Subed, now i wont think I'm a complete ass hat when people are talking 
about cars in school
##
Dude, can any car get 200 hp gain with that big nozzle or whatever??
##
omg yes it did. Thank You!! lol. But I always thought that Nitrous 
backfires had to do with leaky valves. Is that all hearsay? 
##
I have a question, wich i would be glad if you could answer: this is all 
fun and games, but you didn't talk about any downsides as you did in almost 
every video. I heard about extreme engine wear when using nitrous system. 
How much of this is true?(not to mention the price of nitrogen, and how 
long does a tank of it last)
##
Yes.
##
Also WOT switches like he mentioned only open at wide open throttle so you 
have optimal fuel/air/nitrous flow and nothing is restricted. Fuel pressure 
switches monitor your pressure so if the fuel pump or solenoid fail for w/e 
reason, nitrous is killed before you lean out and blow up. You can read 
your AFR off of a wideband o2 sensor as well to make sure you dont lean 
out. The only cons are engine wear in huge shots, and careless 
applications. Otherwise it can be done appropriately!
##
Great video! Got a full overview of how nitrous and the system works, 
Thanks ! :)
##
thats what i was thinking of too
##
Would this work on a Mitsubishi eclipse gts 3.0 ?
##
If the air/fuel mixture is too rich then perhaps, or if the burn duration 
is extended then maybe. But Hollywood makes things look way better :)
##
I have a video on carbs. Also, you don't need to request information in 
more than one comment - I read them all. 
##
Great videos. All are very detailed and in depth. You are a great 
engineer!!!
##
Hey what's a drive shaft?
##
So obviously we know the positives of the Nitrous system but are there any 
negatives to the system?
##
Just wanted to say thanks for all the straight to the point videos, 
everyone on youtube should take note that this is how you provide 
information to the masses. So much of youtube, especially about automotives 
is filler and nothing to do with anything.
##
You'll blow the welds on your intake.
##
You don't like research? XD
##
Could be!
##
You deserve more views! Thanks man!
##
Yep.
##
Do one about wheel hop! 
##
Amazing videos man keep it up! :) 
##
Keep in mind, the catalytic converter reduces HydroCarbon (gasoline) 
exhaust emissions. it is most likely to occur on a car that has no 
cat-converter, an engine in the back of the car, an early exhaust valve 
opening (after combustion), low compression ratios, and short exhaust 
pipes. I have modified some old car with carburetors, and flames can fire 
out the rear if you do it correctly.
##
I have a whole playlist on forced induction, look for it on my channel 
page! :)
##
First, Thanks for your great efforts getting these videos up with a lot of 
easy understood info!! I have one question, what are the "side effects" of 
nitrous on your system? thanks
##
Nitrous comes out of the nozzle at approximately -127deg F(as mentioned in 
the above video) when running for a short period of time you can use the 
nitrous to chill the air charge. Nitrous and Water/Methanol systems are a 
very popular combo on turbo drag cars
##
Well I'd say one big disadvantage is it isn't really a permanent power 
increase, so if you're going on track days you won't be able to sustain the 
increase in power, without swapping bottles. It's probably best for drag 
strips where the car is only running WOT for a fraction of a minute. 
##
wow, great channel! subscribed.
##
or automotive mechanics depending where you're from or what's available
##
Did you intend to post this on my new Corvette video?
##
Did you get to keep the nitro kit or did you have to send it back 
afterwards? And if you get to keep it are you going to put it onto your 
car??
##
Do you have to do anything special to the engine i have a 3800 series 2, 
3.8L what do you think? Ive heard i have to get forged pistons
##
You should do some videos about diesel engines. Not jettas. More like my 
f250. I'm pushing 1200 ft/lbs of torque. You know what they say horsepower 
sells cars torque wins races
##
You deserve far more video views than you get mate, keep up the good work! 
:)
##
oh i thought you were referring to 200 shot of nitrous on a a stock engine, 
being as it is a video about nitrous
##
You want a nozzle that atomizes well at the HP level you are jetting the 
system at for your application.
##
200 + HP here I come
##
I really want to get a nissan pulsar gti-r
##
Good points, especially about not having a closed loop at WOT. 
##
Um I just commented and once I reread my comment I noticed it made no sense 
my bad just ignore it lol.
##
Hey, i really enjoy the way you explain so if you can explain the oil feed 
line to a turbo charge it will be awesome That's my first thanx coz im sure 
that you will do it :)
##
I'd love to see a video explaining Drag Coefficients in detail.
##
Awesome video as usual!
##
I do. Sorry if I came off like a dick haha but still what you said is way 
off. It can be done very safely if you have the time and patience to learn 
before you do anything. Safeties include window switches (recall how torque 
is always higher than hp until 5250rpm) so this switch keeps nitrous off 
until around 3300 rpm, or whatever you set it too. It also cuts nitrous a 
few hundred rpm before your set shift points so you dont spray nitrous 
while off the throttle and blow the engine. next post:
##
you should explain this with a rotary engine diagram. Blow some minds!
##
Made sense, no worries!
##
Thank you for this video! Really informative, but how much would such a wet 
system cost?
##
Just to be sure. When you trigger the nitrous system, does it empty the 
whole bottle or do you control the duration of the shot?
##
youre videos are great man i learn so much information from you its 
awesome, dont stop making the vids!
##
Have a video about Forced Induction?? 
##
Too lean would cause overheat, yes. The jets (nozzles) control flow rate, 
yes. As for your final questions, depending on how much extra power you put 
in, you'll need to upgrade internal components. 
##
Hi there. Really great videos. On an unrelated topic I'd like to ask. Is 
Oxygen flamable at any state. the reason I ask is because I heard that they 
use Liquid O2 in rocketships as fuel. don't remember where I heard this and 
don't know if it's correct. When I went on a fire drill coarse they say 
Oxygen is NOT flamable. If oxygen is flamable at a curtain state, can you 
explain a bit. Thanks for your time
##
$400+ 
##
I'll also add that I wouldn't use it on a track car, only drags. Too much 
on/off throttle in the track to increase the chance of spraying for a 
moment while you let off throttle. Drag is straight forward.
##
you've got some great vids man, very well explained stuff. Coud you perhaps 
do a vid on water-methanol injection too? cheers
##
just dont blow the welds on your intake kid lol
##
A sudden addition of 200hp seems like I could harm the engine?
##
Wow thanks i just put some nitrous on my fiat 500 and it goes well!! :D
##
Could you do a video explaining oil weight? (I.e. 5w-30, 0w-20, 70w-90 and 
so on)
##
Awsm that i found your vids!
##
Truly appreciate the recognition, I try my best to keep things clear and 
concise. I agree completely, so many videos I watch just say "and this 
means the right tire gets more grip" and go no further. Tell me why!! It's 
frustrating, and I think it's part of the reason my channel has been 
growing so well. Thanks for watching!
##
Added weight, if your engine isn't built to handle the added pressure/temp 
of course it could fail. 
##
does the engine have to be modified?
##
For your viewing pleasure, Michael. 
##
Mechanical engineering.
##
He's just referring to the joint program between Subaru and Toyota. Scion 
FRS/Toyota BRZ.
##
Because nitrogen boils at -127 F. In the tank, it is compressed, keeping it 
a liquid. When it is exposed to the outside air, it instantly boils, 
dropping its temperature to -127 F. Changes in state means a big energy 
difference. Don't know if you've ever played paintball, you'll experience 
the same thing. As you shoot the paintball gun, it gets cold near the top 
of the CO2 tank; this is the liquid CO2 changing state and losing energy. 
##
Great video. Do you think you can create a video on diesel engines and how 
they differ from petrol engines?
##
Stops injecting while you're not on the throttle.
##
ive been going through heaps of your videos for the past hour or so. very 
informative and interesting stuff. i also kinda enjoyed watching you change 
from shy and withheld to open and welcoming as your videos progressed. 
great work, keep it up and definitely subscribed. 
##
Add it to you car. 
##
do you have to tune your car with the kit or since it is a wet shot it 
tunes itself? Well not really tune itself but run at a correct mixture
##
It's used to make sure the nitrous line is filled with nitrous, and ready 
to be injected (no bubbles, etc). It simply purges out some nitrous, 
ensuring the line is full. 
##
A knock on/to what?
##
What About the Direct Port Nitrous Injection????
##
Nah, I'm not looking to build it. We "can't" do it in Europe, tough laws on 
the matter. I still have to pass inspection. I was just wondering. I don't 
race. But if I had 10k under the hood I wouldn't need Nitrous ;) 
##
Great to hear!
##
If you had individual throttle bodies installed on your car would you then 
have to install multiple plates for the nitrous system.
##
Explain the HHO generator to the people :) 
##
This is also very wrong, if you've never used nitrous you shouldn't post 
false info about it. It does not smell any different, test pipes or a 
downpipe/cat delete will give you a gassy smell. Not nitrous. And its also 
not called "NOS". That is a brand. It's like asking your mother to pass you 
the "Uncle Bens" instead of rice. It also doesn't ruin your engine at all 
if done properly but you've clearly never done the research. Maybe you 
should actually watch this video. Or learn how it works.
##
well i understood the whole concept of nitrous working principle thanks for 
the video, will it effect on my engines performance in the future if i stop 
using nitrous.
##
thank you sir
##
where can I get nitrous oxide? I'm having a party :)
##
I like this video so much , well explained , thanks 
##
Why does it only boost at full throttle? Can you set it to inject nitrous 
at half throttle for example?
##
These videos are more informative than the classes at my engineering college
##
Thats awesome, you rock!! when the car is doing it's nitrus thing does 
purple stuff come out of the exhaust like in video games or Hollywood and 
does it makea really cool hissing sounds or is that just for effect? How 
long would the bottle last for?
##
Awesome explanation. Cheers!
##
I'm interested in Nitrous backfires, why they happen and how they can be 
prevented. Also water/meth vs nitrous seeing as nitrous does something 
similar to water/meth in it's application it makes me wonder how much could 
be had replacing the water/meth with nitrous and then matching something 
along the lines of a cfi or tbi for a good ratio. 
##
No awesome purple flames, unfortunately. I believe NX recommends not using 
nitrous longer than periods of 10 seconds or less. Maybe a bit more. It's 
not something you'd constantly run, as you'd run out fairly quickly. Great 
for drag races, not so hot for endurance track days. 
##
Bottles are refillable usually costs around $45 to refill. Nitrous systems 
start much cheaper ($399 for a basic system) than turbo/supercharger 
setups. If you do decide to go forced induction later on, nitrous will 
still work just as good when used in conjunction with the other power 
adders, and N2o will reduce air intake temps and help control detonation. 
##
Very informative video! I liked it!
##
yes, as long as a diesel has enough fuel to burn the nitrous it will work 
great! no engine parts will have to be changed. As a general rule of thumb, 
if it smokes it has enough fuel to add some nitrous.
##
Well, I suppose in the F&F movies, when they press it, they're already at 
WOT, so it could actually be accurate. If it's already at WOT, all it would 
need is for the on switch to be flicked to activate it. 
##
You can, but I personally wouldn't. A diesel naturally runs at a higher 
compression, meaning it has a higher acceleration rate anyway. That is why 
when you romp on it in a diesel it throws you back and just takes off. 
Personally, nitrous on a diesel would be pointless, just get a performance 
turbocharger.
##
Theoretically you could use it on anything, but you may have to build up 
the engine for the added stresses. 
##
good video 
##
Yes it is! It's used in anesthesia, mixed with oxygen. But it's also called 
the laughing gas when inhaled pure... a well-known side effect among med 
school students ;)
##
Hey in fast and furious 4 when Dom opens the valve of the nitrous bottle 
for the car to explode, since the nitrous is in a gas form it is a dry shot 
right? ps. make a video showing your car :)
##
Thanks!
##
should the entire cooling system upgraded when installing nos..e.g oil 
cooler intercooler..etc tq﻿
##
Or you can just inhale it.﻿
##
Dude amazing videos! All the indepth, nerdy car questions I had - explained 
in simple videos. 

cheers﻿
##
Why don't you use complete words?
##
the first thx
