##
You have lowering as 0-4". Usually this isn't the case, even on the highest 
setting you'll be looking at an inch of lowering minimum.﻿
##
It's called a McPherson strut,not a coilover.﻿
##
Joe. What car and what offset? You may need to roll your fenders out to 
accommodate for the width/offset. I both of those are in order, you need to 
either raise ride height or stiffen your suspension.﻿
##
I also have a 99 intergra!﻿
##
Nice vid. pretty thorough. Got my Skunk 2 pro S2's going on my 8th gen Si 
tomorrow. They are known for being a bit harsh as far as coilovers so I 
think I'm going to try and keep the spring pre-load to a minimum. :)﻿
##
Shit suspension. You removed all wheel travel, have more weight transfer 
between the front wheels and have no clue what to set the shitty, unmatched 
damping at
##
So if I have coil overs, can I adjust the ride height while they're 
installed on the car? Or do I have to adjust ride height before 
installation? I know you have to jack up the car and take the tire off
##
thanks man :D
##
Yep, and yep. I have a few videos on the installation, and one on testing 
them as well. Cheers. 
##
Yes, but if you lower a car 4 inches for driving on a regular shitty road 
you can't even drive fast enough to get the body roll to begin with....its 
like driving a contradiction; driving a car that can barely drive....﻿
##
did these go on your integra? and is your integra a dc4? because i can not 
find any coilover here in NZ that will fit my car!! 
##
It depends, you CAN but eventually your stock strut will blow. The lower 
you go, the faster the strut will go. If you lower only about an inch on 
stock struts it should last pretty darn long but any lower it will blow 
your strut within 6months to a year.
##
They may fit, but that doesn't necessarily mean the damping and spring 
rates are properly matched, or that you won't break the shocks on a heavy 
bump. Unless they're simply an OEM replacement, with the same height. 
##
One more question. If the springs are marked to fit "Original Equipment 
Manufacturer" shocks will it be ok? 
##
Thank you very much for this. I will rather keep money for full set, or 
maybe a new car. :D
##
The problem with lowering springs on stock shocks is you reduce useable 
shock travel, so your shocks could potentially bottom out. Also, the 
dampening rates of the shocks may not match the spring rates of the 
springs, so it may cause an overly bouncy ride. 
##
Can I install lower springs on stock shocks without causing any problems? 
Is it dangerous to buy cheeper springs or rather choose some better mark? 
Are there any legality issues with lowering your car? Thank you for 
response, it will help me a lot because I plan to buy lower springs.
##
Thanks!
##
Seems like you simply have tires that are too large, or too offset. I'd 
stay closer to OEM spec. 
##
Great explanation, helps a lot. Sub'd
##
Thanks defiantly subscribing :)
##
I've got a 18x9.75 20 off set on 225/40/18 and it stances out. it rubs 
against the fender when going over a bump. how do we avoid rubbing the 
fenders? do we roll the fenders or get a camber kit. i'm on stock coilovers.
##
thanks man, always wanted to learn about this stuff but they never had auto 
in High school! >_o
##
If you plan on lowering your car, and don't have adjustable camber, it's a 
good idea to get one to prevent uneven tire wear, or if you want the 
ability to adjust it for track use. 
##
If you have coilovers do you have to install a camber kit?
##
That's what this video's about. Check out my other suspension videos if 
interested. 
##
yeah, alignment is always recommended. But if you are lowered, and do not 
want the negative camber it is suggested to get a "camber kit" to correct 
that negative camber. And then get a alignment. 
##
What's a coilover why do they even exist
##
What did you not understand? I have a suspensions playlist that goes into 
much greater detail of many of the topics. 
##
You need to simplify your explanations. Talk about fewer subjects but more 
in depth about each subject. I feel like I get a gloss-over for even the 
topical subjects.
##
Check out my video "suspensions - explained." Damping comes from the shock 
absorber. 
##
is damping the same as spring compression?
##
you cant change the compression on the spring. F=kx
##
It shouldn't affect anything apart of fuel economy (it will be better, 
since power steering oil pump goes all the time even when not turning). Of 
course steering effort will be significantly higher, not only because it 
dosn't assist you but also power steering racks have "faster" gearing (less 
turns from lock to lock meaning higher effort to turn wheels)) and the rack 
alone might have higher friction due to added parts vs manual steering rack.
##
Yep, about -2.0 degrees neg camber. 
##
Talking about camber issues, have you done a wheel alignment after 
installing the coilovers?
##
Depends if there is anything else that is powered by that belt. 
##
@Engineering Explained . Excuse me sir but i have a question .. it is bad 
to run a engine without the power steering belt?? It is bad to do or does 
it affect anything on the car??
##
Yes, I'll have install videos soon.
##
Did you replace stock suspension with these? I think knowing your old setup 
would help us with your impression of the new setup.
##
I love how the guy demanded the answer for the yanakas. Lmbo.
##
Perhaps if I get a set of scales I could do so, yes. 
##
Read the comment one below.
##
Can you explain how to corner weight balance your coilovers on your car?
##
Just installed them this past weekend. Quite noticeably stiffer. Ride 
quality suffers a little but it does seem to stay very flat in corners. 
I'll need to get some upper control arms to take care of the negative 
camber, I've lowered it a good amount. 
##
for the millionth time how do they ride????!?!?!
##
Loving the thumbnails. There is nothing more enjoyable than holding a car 
part with a million dollar smile.
##
Have you installed the coilovers? If so how are the yonaka coilovers ride?
##
Hoping to get them installed this weekend!
##
Great video. I am in line to know more info about how these coilovers work 
for you. I've been going back and forth on wanting to pick a set up but 
there isn't too much info on these.
##
I will have videos of the install, and hopefully a test video as well. 
##
Would you please comment your thoughts and impression once you've 
installed/tested them out.
##
They seem to be pretty good quality. I have not yet installed them, and 
plan on doing so hopefully this weekend. Initial impression though they 
seem good, and the spring rates are in line with other aftermarket 
manufacturers. 
##
Hello, great videos, greats bits of insight. I have a '98 4door Integra gs 
and want to beef up my suspicion (its stock) basically for daily driving 
and spirited weekend driving (canyon curves). I liked the price on the 
yonaka spec1 coilovers. What are your thoughts on them, and would you 
recommend them as far as performance and ride quality? Should I go with a 
bit more adjustable, expensive set-up?
##
They do not pay me to do reviews, they simply provide me with material in 
order to enhance my videos. It's much better when I can have the actual 
item when explaining something. They've been very generous in helping out, 
and I appreciate it quite a bit. Doesn't hurt that I get to use some of 
these parts on my car! :)
##
I'm assuming you are sponsored by Yonaka and get paid to do reviews on 
their products?
##
also this is in a miata with race ride height and it's a 92' so I didn't 
expect much with worn bushings and all.
##
I have spec 2's. The 32 adjustments are nice, but it controls rebound and 
compression at the same time, vs the more expensive ones that have 
adjustments for both. Basically stiff to gooey ride. Mine ride pretty damn 
rough but with my alignment it corners awesome. I would only buy these for 
auto x/ track days and not street as a budget solution 550 bucks. Imo shell 
out the extra bucks for better coilovers, another 1-200 bucks get's you a 
full race and decent street ride. 
##
The spec1 may simply mean that the damping is not adjustable. Though I have 
not yet installed mine, the build quality looks to be good. I need to 
install mine! 
##
Hey Engineering Explained I Have An Important Question! I Really Want A 
Pair Of These YONAKA COILOVERS For My 99' Eclipse But I See The Only Yonaka 
Coilovers For The Eclipse That I Can Find Are The Yonaka Coilovers SPEC1! 
Please Let Me Know If The Yonaka Coilovers SPEC1 Are GOOD Coilovers? And 
What Is The Difference Between The Spec1's AND Spec2's?
##
OH AND IN THE 'WHAT TO LOOK FOR' PORTION OF YOUR VIDEO Is That In The 
Spec1's?
##
You are the knower of all things to be known, that's why you know 
things........and make the big bucks hahaha. Thanks, I get it now.
##
Absolutely. 
##
So, if I'm understanding this correctly....you can use a coilover in a 
MacPherson strut suspension?
##
Yes, many do this, but it does alter the pre-load of the spring. 
##
MacPherson strut is basically a type of suspension, I have a video on the 
topic. A coilover can be used in various suspension types. 
##
Isn't a coilover the same as a MacPherson strut?
##
Thanks again for the great explanation
##
Hey is there a coilover that has adjustable ride height but with out having 
to take the coilover off the car and using the threaded ride height 
adjustment 
##
I have not, need to get on it! 
##
Check out my video "suspensions - explained" for detailed answer. It 
dissipates the energy absorbed by the springs when they are loaded (from 
bumps, turning, accelerating, braking, etc.). 
##
Can you please explain what dampering does to your car? let me rephrase 
that. what is dampering? what does it do?
##
White board?
##
Thanks for the answer. But I already bought one now. :)
##
Sucks how you drove a front wheel car man go rear Honda are wach and acura
##
Please try to include the electrical suspensions explanation. I am still 
wondering how they do it in BMW and the technical geeks do not have a 
straight answer to that. ( hardening the suspension with a press of a 
button) thanks :) 
##
Altering the height of the coilover will not change the spring rate, so the 
coils will be just as stiff.
##
Jason, how sound of the exam system varies?
##
those look like stance coilovers.
##
I've been in the working world for 1 year now, and I drive a 99 Acura 
Integra. So yeah I'm pretty much a millionaire at this point. ;)
##
Rally car coil overs are massive!
##
What is that board called?
##
so i bought a car that was lowered, but with the roads where i live and the 
way i drive, a lowered car will do me more pain then good. I am planning on 
raising my car back up to around its regular ride height, but i also am 
looking to soften the suspension a little. If i just raise my coilovers 
back up will it soften my suspension at all ??? or is it nessesary if i am 
looking to soften my suspension to also adjust the tension on the coil?? 
##
Do you already got rich being engineer ?
##
You sound like steve nash
##
I didnt mean that rich.. but a good money more than median works around 
there ? Here in my country.. enginering its a high lvl work
##
I also drive an integra, and i have bwr coilovers, they came with the car, 
but my neighborhood hates slammed cars, so i wanted to raise it a bit from 
what the last guy had it set to. when i did this, i believe it compressed 
the spring, it's been making a squeeky noise from the rear. the spring is 7 
inches now, i dont know if you need to know that. earlier i tried to loosen 
it but when i did, the spring didn't pop pop with the preload. it just 
stayed compressed. what did i do?
##
Is the benefit of Coilovers in the front really that big over a normal 
Macpherson Strut? I've got coilovers for the rear in my e36 m3. Would you 
recommend getting them in the front as well?
##
kg is not a force, it's a mass. force is measured in newtons or lbs
##
awesome!!! very interested in that!!!!!!
##
In some racing videos ive seen as they do practice laps with the car, they 
sometimes say the springs are too hard and it would perform better if its 
slightly softer. How does a spring thats too hard worsen the performance?
##
OK so a car I want has coilovers but they are very bouncy... Do I need to 
replace the whole thing or just get new coil over sleeves
##
Yes, but by using stiffer springs you aren't reducing the "independence" of 
the suspension. Sway bars act as a link for the two, but are a cheaper 
solution to the problem of body roll.
##
your videos are awesome! seriously man.
##
The cheapest option is lowering springs, but there are reasons you don't 
want to do this. It won't allow for the full travel of your shock (likely) 
if you do this, where as coilovers will allow for lowering without altering 
suspension travel (of the included shock, not all do this, but most do). 
Also, to get things done right, you may have to get an alignment to alter 
your camber and toe to make up for the change in geometry. 
##
hey buddy ....u are the best and your tech. stuff is awesum!!!Could u 
please explain the front and rear suspension of a motorcycle....???
##
I have a couple, search my channel for "steering."
##
What do you drive?
##
I agree with BigDette! The first guy simply asked if the guy was going to 
put them on his car. He didn't ask what they go on the second guy needs to 
learn how to read lol 
##
Yes, eventually.
##
I'll get around to it at some point, yes. 
##
No problem I am sure they will feel bad after they read the conversation 
slowly hahaha 
##
I don't get what's the difference between coilovers and a mcpherson strut. 
Anyone care to explain?
##
I've ever heard about the Citroen's﻿ Hydractive system ? Check it out, it's 
very interesting ;) /watch?v=zuqJPurdRJw
##
When you install the coil overs I would greatly encourage you to upgrade 
your anti sway bars (they're usually pretty in expensive... considering the 
results) ... You will be pleasantly surprised (I think) with the 
improvement of the handing of you car. Hondas/ Acuras usually have pretty 
soft antisway bars. Potentially you could show the G's your car could pull 
before and after the modification... 
##
look who's talking, the person that cant understand sarcasm.
##
will this mess with alingment and camber ? i assume you're going to need a 
camber adjustment/kit
##
man, do you have any videos about steering, like steering linkages or 
steering gears? I really need them as I am having a had time with it.
##
ah i see thanks
##
Alignment with adjustable coilovers is a PITA.
##
Got video requests.
##
no dude, they go on submarines. *facepalm*
##
Do you even try?
##
i hear people say my shocks are shot. what exactly does this mean? it 
doesnt really seem like that system can break unless its really does just 
completely break
##
Keep it up buddy, these videos are very helpful. Can you do some on Mohr's 
Circle, Stress theory etc. 
##
Thanks!
##
Eventually I could make a video on this, yes. It's a good topic but also 
gets very complicated very quickly. 
##
Good man! :) 
##
You seem to have implied that these are designed to work with Earth's 
gravity.. does this mean that they are inappropriate for a Lunar or Martian 
rover, or say, a Venusian Fire Rover?
##
Good ole' Mohr's circle. Perhaps one day, I'm trying to keep most videos 
automotive related, but perhaps if I got into chassis stresses or something 
of the like. 
##
Pre-loading the springs does not change the stiffness of the springs. 
Unfortunately if you want stiff you'd need different springs. That said, 
you may be able to achieve what you want to do cheaper with anti-roll bars, 
not really sure what your goal is though. 
##
it will be stiffer for sure but I think the lower u go the stiffer it 
becomes as it has to restrict tires from hitting the fender curve! 
##
I know that answer bro but what does inertia do. We learn that it's not a 
force but it reacts at speed change why inertia makes weight or better load 
tranfer ?
##
So far Yonaka has been a great partner in helping make these videos. My 
relationship with Redline360 is growing as well, which has great potential. 
##
Thanks, yes there are definitely additional factors which need to be 
altered to maintain an ideal geometry of the suspension. I do hope to make 
a few videos on ride height, cg, and roll centers to expand on this. 
Eventually :)
##
if its to hard there wont be any give at all, which can end up breaking 
tracking and causing slippage. Ideally you want a stiff enough spring to 
prevent roll as much as possible, but soft enough to allow some roll so 
that the car doesn't break traction on hard corners.
##
I don't plan on dropping it 4 inches, maybe 1" at the most. I live in a 
city where a lowered car is incredibly impractical. Once this is my 
"track-only" car I'll go a little more, depending on if I can get the 
suspension geometry correct. 
##
yes (based on my own experience). I lowered my car 2.34" (6cm) front/ 1.57" 
(4cm) rear with springs only (apex yellow) and had them on for two weeks 
only. Strut mounts were gone in a few days and then the front shocks leaked 
(a bicycle hand pump was harder to work than my shock absorbers) and had to 
be replaced. I went back to stock springs and new shocks all around and new 
strut mounts for the front shock absorbers.
##
Keep it up! Enjoying the videos! Most helpful one to me was the videos 
about torsen lsd's.
##
This guy is the definition of what a ricer is not.
##
Hopefully I'll have a video up at some point. 
##
Hence I said "with gravity being 9.81 m/s" aka what gravity is for most of 
us. 
##
Explained, Engineering Explained. :)
##
You are a moron, sir. He was asking they were going on HIS car, not a car 
in general. Good job at misunderstanding a simple sentence. 
##
Dude, awesome video man. It's crazy how much I have learned on this 
channel, and how it conceptually helps with physics (Which I'm taking now!) 
Also, I think you should do a walk around of your Integra soon! Perhaps 
after you install these coilovers, best of luck and don't stop making 
videos!
##
Soon enough!
##
I'm willing to bet you're going to need some serious negative camber if 
they bring your 'tegra down 4".
##
how to know what's your car's spring rate is?
##
Thank you! Glad to hear.
##
do good quality coilovers last longer that stock oem shocks and struts?
##
Can I request a video topic of "most cost effective upgrades for cars"?
##
"you don't want metal on metal contact because terrible things will happen" 
LOL
##
MacPherson strut is a type or variant of a suspension. A coilover can 
replace the spring/strut combo already in place in the MacPherson strut 
setup. 
##
that depends on how low you want to go you should consider lowering springs 
since they can offer better spring rates versus a full coil over 
##
what car do you drive? Also just wondering where did you learn all this 
about cars? Did you just learn from books/internet, did you go to school, 
or maybe from your dad?
##
That's awesome man. Keep up the good work!
##
Is he the Linus Tech Tips of cars?
##
Whats the difference between Mcpherson strut and coilover spring?
##
I'll probably get around to a sway bar eventually. I'll likely try to go 
with the Type-R set-up. 
##
"and now, compliments of SPOON, were putting a new K20 into the integra, 
heres how it works!" lol ;D
##
Remember to be careful when talking about 'lbs' as a force. I know what you 
mean, but I think it's more informative to write it as 'lbf' for forces and 
'lbm' for masses. That way they won't get mixed up.
##
The shock itself is mainly to control rebound is it not?
##
can you do a video on suspension geometry???
##
Check out the link "automotive careers" on the "About" page of my channel. 
I've written an article for you. :)
##
Great Channel, I'm a gear head and I've been around cars for 20+yrs. I 
understand about 95% of all your topics before watching, but it's always 
good to review and refresh. I appreciate what you do for the other viewers. 
PS I would suggest a companion video to this explaining adjustable 
suspension arms and upgrading bushings, as these are a must have to 
maintain proper geometry after altering ride height. Keep up the 
informative and unbiased work!!
##
The stiffness of the springs, when measured in "kg" under a different 
gravitational pull, would ultimately be a different force. Indeed, they are 
not certified by the "space administration" and should not be used on the 
moon! 
##
teach! do you keep these parts and use them on your car or do you send them 
back?
##
Correct me if I'm wrong, from a driver's perspective, the dampers are used 
to tune the car's behavior while under braking or accelerating (corner 
entry and exit), but during that steady state part of the corner while the 
car is coasting the sway bars are used to tune the car's behavior. 
##
I just got some 18inch alloy wheels fitted on my car, I now want to lower 
the height to give the car a more sporty look, should I use coilovers or 
lowering springs? what are the pros/cons of each? thanks
##
do it!! Ill help
##
So it looks to me like a Coilover is the same thing as a McPherson Strut, 
except it's adjustable for height & spring compression... Are there any 
other differences?
##
thanks mate you re the best! keep those vids coming!!! i've learned so many 
things 
##
Are you this retarded??
##
very good video
##
The main purpose for coilovers is to corner balance the car. But most 
people don't' even know what that is and just use them to lower their cars 
and be "cool".
##
welp one of my springs broke and is making all kinds of noise -_-
##
Why traction bars?
##
do you repair everything in ur car by yourself ? 
##
Hmmb... Damn mechanical engineering is interesting!! 
##
is it bad to have lowering springs on normal suspensions vs coilovers?
##
I love that there are now sponsors for your videos (these are sponsored 
products right?) so we have props in addition to your detailed drawings. 
Plus your car will get nicer.
##
Very good video, can you explain on wheel stifness and contribution to 
vehicle noise
##
The "full threaded body" feature is not an indication of an expensive 
coilover anymore. Companies can just develop the lower threaded portion and 
top hat and pass off a generic shock-body/valving as a coilover 
specifically designed for different cars. Could you do a video on how 
spring preload affects or doesn't affect handling? I think that argument 
needs to be put to rest. Videos are more and more interesting!
##
Could you please do a video on powerglide transmission?
##
Why does weight tranfering occur ? What happens or what forces are applyed 
to the car when accelerating and deaccelerating ? 
##
Correct, depending on the suspension (double wishbone, macpherson, etc.) 
the top of the coilover will have a different mounting. A MacPherson strut 
will likely have a 3rd screw on top. 
##
ehe that was fun!
##
It's inertia, google it
##
Luckily I haven't had too much go wrong with it. I certainly don't do 
everything. I've just replaced the distributor cap and thermostat. I've 
taken it to the shop to fix oil leaks/burning, but I think what truly needs 
to happen is a full engine rebuild. 
##
does the coilover get stiffer if you add preload aka compress the springs 
more? I have full threaded coilovers and want to stiffen them without 
replacing the springs.
##
Explain "No Load/Full Load" of a engine please.
##
first! and cool i was waiting for this vid. and side note where could i get 
some cheap but good coilovers
##
YOU ARE THE ONE YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND A BASIC QUESTION! An then respond with 
a stupid answer like: "submarines"
##
An Integra.
##
You talking to me?? Go sit down scrub.
##
Thanks that woud be interesting; also what tricks that are used to utilize 
airflow on the chassis etc. 
##
7:09
##
EXACTLY EXACTLY EXACTLY. A lot of people don't understand that sway bars 
aren't a good thing. Its a cheating and cheap way to reduce body roll at 
the expense of suspension independence. The perfect suspension wouldn't 
have sway bars or would have a sway bar with a clutch. 
##
you're super lucky getting all these free parts for your car, you should 
buy an expensive car and start doing more power adding mods ;D
##
why would anyone buy yonaka coils..................., and also isn't the 
bumpstop to stop the shock from bottoming out, so they dont blow? p.s. a 
12kg spring will make your back ache, i have 6.3 kg spring all around and 
they are pretty stiff, bearable but stiff
##
When are you going to install all of those parts to make a track integra 
race car ? @EngineeringExplained
##
Are they going on your car?
##
Hi, just got this idea: could you explain what is meant by airresistance 
dragcoefficient. Given also the wheelhorsepower one could calculate the 
(theoretical) maximum speed of a vehicle, right? If you could show us the 
formulas?
##
Eventually, hopefully, yes. I'd like to get into CG and roll center. 
##
Yaaaaaaay COILOVERS!!!!
##
You have a natural skill for explaining things, Great job on all these vids 
man!
##
Does it have something to do with the rotating wheel?
##
Nice comeback <3
##
"You should buy an expensive car." That part requires enough money for an 
expensive car. :)
##
can you make a video of your car, kinda curious to see what it looks like?
##
Your videos are very helpful. So a lot of companies sponser you with there 
products?
##
Email me at husker54@hotmail.com some time. I'm going into Mechanical 
Engineering this coming year and would like to pick your brain for advice 
as I would like to go automotive with it
##
It could be that the fluid, or some of it, has managed to break a seal and 
leaked out, thus making the shock absorbers of no use. 
##
We're all happy, things are going well!
##
make a video of the installation!! 
##
Alright.. you're starting to humor me more then trying to make a good 
comeback unless you have something worth saying... shut up
##
Whats your name? 
##
Side to side weight transfer or "roll" isn't that what sway bars are for?
##
Are you trying to talk?
##
99 Integra GS, I've got a more detailed answer to that question on my FAQ, 
which you can find on the "about" link on my channel. 
##
Are you.. Are you serious right now?
##
Thank you sir, Glad to see that someone else sees sense in this 
conversation!
##
So would you suggest coilovers over loaded struts? I really don't know 
which to buy! 1993 honda accord
##
Man this videos are sooooo informative, its so easy to understand, it 
doesnt even matter the fact that english is not my native language. I 
really apreciate the fact that you take the time to share your knowledge. 
Ive learned a lot from you, Im a ver happy subscriber, always waiting for 
new videos. Greetings from El Salvador :)
##
so only better solution is to get whole coilover set :)
##
Well that would be nice . Yesterday i checked 'the physics of racing" by 
Brian Beckman and read his theory about weight tranfer . I understood it 
but it should be more easy than his explanation . He used the concept that 
like he said "The braking forces create a rotating tendency, or torque" . 
and the braking objects have a tendecny to rotate over just like a car is 
trying to rotate in his nose while braking . So i want to ask when such 
weight tranfer occur the center of gravity changes right?. 
##
Can u.please explain magentic ride/suspension. Really want to know what 
makes the difference. Plz!
##
I wonder where bitches like fanargo comes from
##
Conservation of momentum. see physics 
##
thanks i learned some
##
sir, what are the lifespan of coilover?
##
Great videos. Can you do some videos on:- dual mass flywheels, variable 
induction systems and balancer shafts
##
could you do an install how to? ps thanks so much for posting videos im 
learning a lot from you! :)
