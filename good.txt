I love you Justin <3 you touched me in concert 8/3/13 :) love you're sweet 
voice :) #alwayskidrauhl #stillkidrauhl I have been a belieber since 2009 
and I am not going anywhere! <3 stay strong Justin haters don't know that 
you actually can sing and that you love you're fans <3 you are so depressed 
but you put on a fake smile everyday because we want you to be happy. You 
taught yourself the drums, guitar, piano and trumpet all before u turned 11 
<3 that's very very talented. <3 :)﻿
##
Guys, just stop hating. I am not a fan of Justin Bieber, but I just hate 
the hating comments. Just stop. He's probably more successful than all of 
you.﻿
##
Love you justin I wish I can see you﻿
##
Still love this video! :)﻿
##
He's a great singer<3.
I love him.﻿
##
Love you Jay! Belieber since the start and always will be.Kisses,Love 
ya,Bye!﻿
##
I love this song so much ﻿
##
very good music﻿
##
Love him so much﻿
##
People are so stupid these days.. like you are seriously going to believe 
everything you read on the Internet. Really? Like people need to realize 
that not everything is true that you read. So stop using every rumor to 
bash an amazing person who did nothing to you.
##
If you hate him so much, why do you come back after years? Just to hate on 
him? He must be doing something right.
##
i miss this so much﻿
##
amazing.. I am so proud of u Justin... you are so changet but the same 
kidrauhl.. <3333 love u from the moon and back #4everabelieber
##
I love jou so ﻿
##
I just cant get over how cute he is... #lovebieber   #alwayswill  ﻿

Leave the kid alone. What great time you have to insult a person for no 
reason. Grow some maturity. Even if you dislake his talent, what did he do 
to you as a person? NOTHING. You negative people are the ones that make 
life a living hell for innocent people. Such filthy heart to hate a kid-15 
or 16 aat the time-. have courage and love and comment good things, or 
nothing what so ever. Only animals are known for savagness, so stop with 
the savagery comments. And apperently he loves his fans, enough to not give 
a bloody second thought of any of you who hate him for no atom weight of 
cause. Good luck writting filthy comments you're whole life while he 
becomes better at the things he does. 
##
I LOOOVE HIM <3 <3﻿
##
Thanks Justin, Argentina Loves you
##
You have lowering as 0-4". Usually this isn't the case, even on the highest 
setting you'll be looking at an inch of lowering minimum.﻿
##
It's called a McPherson strut,not a coilover.﻿
##
Joe. What car and what offset? You may need to roll your fenders out to 
accommodate for the width/offset. I both of those are in order, you need to 
either raise ride height or stiffen your suspension.﻿
##
I also have a 99 intergra!﻿
##
Nice vid. pretty thorough. Got my Skunk 2 pro S2's going on my 8th gen Si 
tomorrow. They are known for being a bit harsh as far as coilovers so I 
think I'm going to try and keep the spring pre-load to a minimum. :)﻿
##
Shit suspension. You removed all wheel travel, have more weight transfer 
between the front wheels and have no clue what to set the shitty, unmatched 
damping at
##
So if I have coil overs, can I adjust the ride height while they're 
installed on the car? Or do I have to adjust ride height before 
installation? I know you have to jack up the car and take the tire off
##
thanks man :D
##
Yep, and yep. I have a few videos on the installation, and one on testing 
them as well. Cheers. 
##
Yes, but if you lower a car 4 inches for driving on a regular shitty road 
you can't even drive fast enough to get the body roll to begin with....its 
like driving a contradiction; driving a car that can barely drive....﻿
##
did these go on your integra? and is your integra a dc4? because i can not 
find any coilover here in NZ that will fit my car!! 
##
It depends, you CAN but eventually your stock strut will blow. The lower 
you go, the faster the strut will go. If you lower only about an inch on 
stock struts it should last pretty darn long but any lower it will blow 
your strut within 6months to a year.
##
They may fit, but that doesn't necessarily mean the damping and spring 
rates are properly matched, or that you won't break the shocks on a heavy 
bump. Unless they're simply an OEM replacement, with the same height. 
##
One more question. If the springs are marked to fit "Original Equipment 
Manufacturer" shocks will it be ok? 
##
Thank you very much for this. I will rather keep money for full set, or 
maybe a new car. :D
##
The problem with lowering springs on stock shocks is you reduce useable 
shock travel, so your shocks could potentially bottom out. Also, the 
dampening rates of the shocks may not match the spring rates of the 
springs, so it may cause an overly bouncy ride. 
##
Can I install lower springs on stock shocks without causing any problems? 
Is it dangerous to buy cheeper springs or rather choose some better mark? 
Are there any legality issues with lowering your car? Thank you for 
response, it will help me a lot because I plan to buy lower springs.
##
Thanks!
##
Seems like you simply have tires that are too large, or too offset. I'd 
stay closer to OEM spec. 
##
Great explanation, helps a lot. Sub'd
##
Thanks defiantly subscribing :)
##
I've got a 18x9.75 20 off set on 225/40/18 and it stances out. it rubs 
against the fender when going over a bump. how do we avoid rubbing the 
fenders? do we roll the fenders or get a camber kit. i'm on stock coilovers.
##
thanks man, always wanted to learn about this stuff but they never had auto 
in High school! >_o
##
If you plan on lowering your car, and don't have adjustable camber, it's a 
good idea to get one to prevent uneven tire wear, or if you want the 
ability to adjust it for track use. 
##
If you have coilovers do you have to install a camber kit?
##
That's what this video's about. Check out my other suspension videos if 
interested. 
##
yeah, alignment is always recommended. But if you are lowered, and do not 
want the negative camber it is suggested to get a "camber kit" to correct 
that negative camber. And then get a alignment. 
##
What's a coilover why do they even exist
##
What did you not understand? I have a suspensions playlist that goes into 
much greater detail of many of the topics. 
##
You need to simplify your explanations. Talk about fewer subjects but more 
in depth about each subject. I feel like I get a gloss-over for even the 
topical subjects.
##
Check out my video "suspensions - explained." Damping comes from the shock 
absorber. 
##
is damping the same as spring compression?
##
you cant change the compression on the spring. F=kx
##
It shouldn't affect anything apart of fuel economy (it will be better, 
since power steering oil pump goes all the time even when not turning). Of 
course steering effort will be significantly higher, not only because it 
dosn't assist you but also power steering racks have "faster" gearing (less 
turns from lock to lock meaning higher effort to turn wheels)) and the rack 
alone might have higher friction due to added parts vs manual steering rack.
##
Yep, about -2.0 degrees neg camber. 
##
Talking about camber issues, have you done a wheel alignment after 
installing the coilovers?
##
Depends if there is anything else that is powered by that belt. 
##
@Engineering Explained . Excuse me sir but i have a question .. it is bad 
to run a engine without the power steering belt?? It is bad to do or does 
it affect anything on the car??
##
Yes, I'll have install videos soon.
##
Did you replace stock suspension with these? I think knowing your old setup 
would help us with your impression of the new setup.
##
I love how the guy demanded the answer for the yanakas. Lmbo.
##
Perhaps if I get a set of scales I could do so, yes. 
##
Read the comment one below.
##
Can you explain how to corner weight balance your coilovers on your car?
##
Just installed them this past weekend. Quite noticeably stiffer. Ride 
quality suffers a little but it does seem to stay very flat in corners. 
I'll need to get some upper control arms to take care of the negative 
camber, I've lowered it a good amount. 
##
for the millionth time how do they ride????!?!?!
##
Loving the thumbnails. There is nothing more enjoyable than holding a car 
part with a million dollar smile.
##
Have you installed the coilovers? If so how are the yonaka coilovers ride?
##
Hoping to get them installed this weekend!
##
Great video. I am in line to know more info about how these coilovers work 
for you. I've been going back and forth on wanting to pick a set up but 
there isn't too much info on these.
##
I will have videos of the install, and hopefully a test video as well. 
##
Would you please comment your thoughts and impression once you've 
installed/tested them out.
##
They seem to be pretty good quality. I have not yet installed them, and 
plan on doing so hopefully this weekend. Initial impression though they 
seem good, and the spring rates are in line with other aftermarket 
manufacturers. 
##
Hello, great videos, greats bits of insight. I have a '98 4door Integra gs 
and want to beef up my suspicion (its stock) basically for daily driving 
and spirited weekend driving (canyon curves). I liked the price on the 
yonaka spec1 coilovers. What are your thoughts on them, and would you 
recommend them as far as performance and ride quality? Should I go with a 
bit more adjustable, expensive set-up?
##
They do not pay me to do reviews, they simply provide me with material in 
order to enhance my videos. It's much better when I can have the actual 
item when explaining something. They've been very generous in helping out, 
and I appreciate it quite a bit. Doesn't hurt that I get to use some of 
these parts on my car! :)
##
I'm assuming you are sponsored by Yonaka and get paid to do reviews on 
their products?
##
also this is in a miata with race ride height and it's a 92' so I didn't 
expect much with worn bushings and all.
##
I have spec 2's. The 32 adjustments are nice, but it controls rebound and 
compression at the same time, vs the more expensive ones that have 
adjustments for both. Basically stiff to gooey ride. Mine ride pretty damn 
rough but with my alignment it corners awesome. I would only buy these for 
auto x/ track days and not street as a budget solution 550 bucks. Imo shell 
out the extra bucks for better coilovers, another 1-200 bucks get's you a 
full race and decent street ride. 
##
The spec1 may simply mean that the damping is not adjustable. Though I have 
not yet installed mine, the build quality looks to be good. I need to 
install mine! 
##
Hey Engineering Explained I Have An Important Question! I Really Want A 
Pair Of These YONAKA COILOVERS For My 99' Eclipse But I See The Only Yonaka 
Coilovers For The Eclipse That I Can Find Are The Yonaka Coilovers SPEC1! 
Please Let Me Know If The Yonaka Coilovers SPEC1 Are GOOD Coilovers? And 
What Is The Difference Between The Spec1's AND Spec2's?
##
OH AND IN THE 'WHAT TO LOOK FOR' PORTION OF YOUR VIDEO Is That In The 
Spec1's?
##
You are the knower of all things to be known, that's why you know 
things........and make the big bucks hahaha. Thanks, I get it now.
##
Absolutely. 
##
So, if I'm understanding this correctly....you can use a coilover in a 
MacPherson strut suspension?
##
Yes, many do this, but it does alter the pre-load of the spring. 
##
MacPherson strut is basically a type of suspension, I have a video on the 
topic. A coilover can be used in various suspension types. 
##
Isn't a coilover the same as a MacPherson strut?
##
Thanks again for the great explanation
##
Hey is there a coilover that has adjustable ride height but with out having 
to take the coilover off the car and using the threaded ride height 
adjustment 
##
I have not, need to get on it! 
##
Check out my video "suspensions - explained" for detailed answer. It 
dissipates the energy absorbed by the springs when they are loaded (from 
bumps, turning, accelerating, braking, etc.). 
##
Can you please explain what dampering does to your car? let me rephrase 
that. what is dampering? what does it do?
##
White board?
##
Thanks for the answer. But I already bought one now. :)
##
Sucks how you drove a front wheel car man go rear Honda are wach and acura
##
Please try to include the electrical suspensions explanation. I am still 
wondering how they do it in BMW and the technical geeks do not have a 
straight answer to that. ( hardening the suspension with a press of a 
button) thanks :) 
##
Altering the height of the coilover will not change the spring rate, so the 
coils will be just as stiff.
##
Jason, how sound of the exam system varies?
##
those look like stance coilovers.
##
I've been in the working world for 1 year now, and I drive a 99 Acura 
Integra. So yeah I'm pretty much a millionaire at this point. ;)
##
Rally car coil overs are massive!
##
What is that board called?
##
so i bought a car that was lowered, but with the roads where i live and the 
way i drive, a lowered car will do me more pain then good. I am planning on 
raising my car back up to around its regular ride height, but i also am 
looking to soften the suspension a little. If i just raise my coilovers 
back up will it soften my suspension at all ??? or is it nessesary if i am 
looking to soften my suspension to also adjust the tension on the coil?? 
##
Do you already got rich being engineer ?
##
You sound like steve nash
##
I didnt mean that rich.. but a good money more than median works around 
there ? Here in my country.. enginering its a high lvl work
##
I also drive an integra, and i have bwr coilovers, they came with the car, 
but my neighborhood hates slammed cars, so i wanted to raise it a bit from 
what the last guy had it set to. when i did this, i believe it compressed 
the spring, it's been making a squeeky noise from the rear. the spring is 7 
inches now, i dont know if you need to know that. earlier i tried to loosen 
it but when i did, the spring didn't pop pop with the preload. it just 
stayed compressed. what did i do?
##
Is the benefit of Coilovers in the front really that big over a normal 
Macpherson Strut? I've got coilovers for the rear in my e36 m3. Would you 
recommend getting them in the front as well?
##
kg is not a force, it's a mass. force is measured in newtons or lbs
##
awesome!!! very interested in that!!!!!!
##
In some racing videos ive seen as they do practice laps with the car, they 
sometimes say the springs are too hard and it would perform better if its 
slightly softer. How does a spring thats too hard worsen the performance?
##
OK so a car I want has coilovers but they are very bouncy... Do I need to 
replace the whole thing or just get new coil over sleeves
##
Yes, but by using stiffer springs you aren't reducing the "independence" of 
the suspension. Sway bars act as a link for the two, but are a cheaper 
solution to the problem of body roll.
##
your videos are awesome! seriously man.
##
The cheapest option is lowering springs, but there are reasons you don't 
want to do this. It won't allow for the full travel of your shock (likely) 
if you do this, where as coilovers will allow for lowering without altering 
suspension travel (of the included shock, not all do this, but most do). 
Also, to get things done right, you may have to get an alignment to alter 
your camber and toe to make up for the change in geometry. 
##
hey buddy ....u are the best and your tech. stuff is awesum!!!Could u 
please explain the front and rear suspension of a motorcycle....???
##
I have a couple, search my channel for "steering."
##
What do you drive?
##
I agree with BigDette! The first guy simply asked if the guy was going to 
put them on his car. He didn't ask what they go on the second guy needs to 
learn how to read lol 
##
Yes, eventually.
##
I'll get around to it at some point, yes. 
##
No problem I am sure they will feel bad after they read the conversation 
slowly hahaha 
##
I don't get what's the difference between coilovers and a mcpherson strut. 
Anyone care to explain?
##
I've ever heard about the Citroen's﻿ Hydractive system ? Check it out, it's 
very interesting ;) /watch?v=zuqJPurdRJw
##
When you install the coil overs I would greatly encourage you to upgrade 
your anti sway bars (they're usually pretty in expensive... considering the 
results) ... You will be pleasantly surprised (I think) with the 
improvement of the handing of you car. Hondas/ Acuras usually have pretty 
soft antisway bars. Potentially you could show the G's your car could pull 
before and after the modification... 
##
look who's talking, the person that cant understand sarcasm.
##
will this mess with alingment and camber ? i assume you're going to need a 
camber adjustment/kit
##
man, do you have any videos about steering, like steering linkages or 
steering gears? I really need them as I am having a had time with it.
##
ah i see thanks
##
Alignment with adjustable coilovers is a PITA.
##
Got video requests.
##
no dude, they go on submarines. *facepalm*
##
Do you even try?
##
i hear people say my shocks are shot. what exactly does this mean? it 
doesnt really seem like that system can break unless its really does just 
completely break
##
Keep it up buddy, these videos are very helpful. Can you do some on Mohr's 
Circle, Stress theory etc. 
##
Thanks!
##
Eventually I could make a video on this, yes. It's a good topic but also 
gets very complicated very quickly. 
##
Good man! :) 
##
You seem to have implied that these are designed to work with Earth's 
gravity.. does this mean that they are inappropriate for a Lunar or Martian 
rover, or say, a Venusian Fire Rover?
##
Good ole' Mohr's circle. Perhaps one day, I'm trying to keep most videos 
automotive related, but perhaps if I got into chassis stresses or something 
of the like. 
##
Pre-loading the springs does not change the stiffness of the springs. 
Unfortunately if you want stiff you'd need different springs. That said, 
you may be able to achieve what you want to do cheaper with anti-roll bars, 
not really sure what your goal is though. 
##
it will be stiffer for sure but I think the lower u go the stiffer it 
becomes as it has to restrict tires from hitting the fender curve! 
##
I know that answer bro but what does inertia do. We learn that it's not a 
force but it reacts at speed change why inertia makes weight or better load 
tranfer ?
##
So far Yonaka has been a great partner in helping make these videos. My 
relationship with Redline360 is growing as well, which has great potential. 
##
Thanks, yes there are definitely additional factors which need to be 
altered to maintain an ideal geometry of the suspension. I do hope to make 
a few videos on ride height, cg, and roll centers to expand on this. 
Eventually :)
##
if its to hard there wont be any give at all, which can end up breaking 
tracking and causing slippage. Ideally you want a stiff enough spring to 
prevent roll as much as possible, but soft enough to allow some roll so 
that the car doesn't break traction on hard corners.
##
I don't plan on dropping it 4 inches, maybe 1" at the most. I live in a 
city where a lowered car is incredibly impractical. Once this is my 
"track-only" car I'll go a little more, depending on if I can get the 
suspension geometry correct. 
##
yes (based on my own experience). I lowered my car 2.34" (6cm) front/ 1.57" 
(4cm) rear with springs only (apex yellow) and had them on for two weeks 
only. Strut mounts were gone in a few days and then the front shocks leaked 
(a bicycle hand pump was harder to work than my shock absorbers) and had to 
be replaced. I went back to stock springs and new shocks all around and new 
strut mounts for the front shock absorbers.
##
Keep it up! Enjoying the videos! Most helpful one to me was the videos 
about torsen lsd's.
##
This guy is the definition of what a ricer is not.
##
Hopefully I'll have a video up at some point. 
##
Hence I said "with gravity being 9.81 m/s" aka what gravity is for most of 
us. 
##
Explained, Engineering Explained. :)
##
You are a moron, sir. He was asking they were going on HIS car, not a car 
in general. Good job at misunderstanding a simple sentence. 
##
Dude, awesome video man. It's crazy how much I have learned on this 
channel, and how it conceptually helps with physics (Which I'm taking now!) 
Also, I think you should do a walk around of your Integra soon! Perhaps 
after you install these coilovers, best of luck and don't stop making 
videos!
##
Soon enough!
##
I'm willing to bet you're going to need some serious negative camber if 
they bring your 'tegra down 4".
##
how to know what's your car's spring rate is?
##
Thank you! Glad to hear.
##
do good quality coilovers last longer that stock oem shocks and struts?
##
Can I request a video topic of "most cost effective upgrades for cars"?
##
"you don't want metal on metal contact because terrible things will happen" 
LOL
##
MacPherson strut is a type or variant of a suspension. A coilover can 
replace the spring/strut combo already in place in the MacPherson strut 
setup. 
##
that depends on how low you want to go you should consider lowering springs 
since they can offer better spring rates versus a full coil over 
##
what car do you drive? Also just wondering where did you learn all this 
about cars? Did you just learn from books/internet, did you go to school, 
or maybe from your dad?
##
That's awesome man. Keep up the good work!
##
Is he the Linus Tech Tips of cars?
##
Whats the difference between Mcpherson strut and coilover spring?
##
I'll probably get around to a sway bar eventually. I'll likely try to go 
with the Type-R set-up. 
##
"and now, compliments of SPOON, were putting a new K20 into the integra, 
heres how it works!" lol ;D
##
Remember to be careful when talking about 'lbs' as a force. I know what you 
mean, but I think it's more informative to write it as 'lbf' for forces and 
'lbm' for masses. That way they won't get mixed up.
##
The shock itself is mainly to control rebound is it not?
##
can you do a video on suspension geometry???
##
Check out the link "automotive careers" on the "About" page of my channel. 
I've written an article for you. :)
##
Great Channel, I'm a gear head and I've been around cars for 20+yrs. I 
understand about 95% of all your topics before watching, but it's always 
good to review and refresh. I appreciate what you do for the other viewers. 
PS I would suggest a companion video to this explaining adjustable 
suspension arms and upgrading bushings, as these are a must have to 
maintain proper geometry after altering ride height. Keep up the 
informative and unbiased work!!
##
The stiffness of the springs, when measured in "kg" under a different 
gravitational pull, would ultimately be a different force. Indeed, they are 
not certified by the "space administration" and should not be used on the 
moon! 
##
teach! do you keep these parts and use them on your car or do you send them 
back?
##
Correct me if I'm wrong, from a driver's perspective, the dampers are used 
to tune the car's behavior while under braking or accelerating (corner 
entry and exit), but during that steady state part of the corner while the 
car is coasting the sway bars are used to tune the car's behavior. 
##
I just got some 18inch alloy wheels fitted on my car, I now want to lower 
the height to give the car a more sporty look, should I use coilovers or 
lowering springs? what are the pros/cons of each? thanks
##
do it!! Ill help
##
So it looks to me like a Coilover is the same thing as a McPherson Strut, 
except it's adjustable for height & spring compression... Are there any 
other differences?
##
thanks mate you re the best! keep those vids coming!!! i've learned so many 
things 
##
Are you this retarded??
##
very good video
##
The main purpose for coilovers is to corner balance the car. But most 
people don't' even know what that is and just use them to lower their cars 
and be "cool".
##
welp one of my springs broke and is making all kinds of noise -_-
##
Why traction bars?
##
do you repair everything in ur car by yourself ? 
##
Hmmb... Damn mechanical engineering is interesting!! 
##
is it bad to have lowering springs on normal suspensions vs coilovers?
##
I love that there are now sponsors for your videos (these are sponsored 
products right?) so we have props in addition to your detailed drawings. 
Plus your car will get nicer.
##
Very good video, can you explain on wheel stifness and contribution to 
vehicle noise
##
The "full threaded body" feature is not an indication of an expensive 
coilover anymore. Companies can just develop the lower threaded portion and 
top hat and pass off a generic shock-body/valving as a coilover 
specifically designed for different cars. Could you do a video on how 
spring preload affects or doesn't affect handling? I think that argument 
needs to be put to rest. Videos are more and more interesting!
##
Could you please do a video on powerglide transmission?
##
Why does weight tranfering occur ? What happens or what forces are applyed 
to the car when accelerating and deaccelerating ? 
##
Correct, depending on the suspension (double wishbone, macpherson, etc.) 
the top of the coilover will have a different mounting. A MacPherson strut 
will likely have a 3rd screw on top. 
##
ehe that was fun!
##
It's inertia, google it
##
Luckily I haven't had too much go wrong with it. I certainly don't do 
everything. I've just replaced the distributor cap and thermostat. I've 
taken it to the shop to fix oil leaks/burning, but I think what truly needs 
to happen is a full engine rebuild. 
##
does the coilover get stiffer if you add preload aka compress the springs 
more? I have full threaded coilovers and want to stiffen them without 
replacing the springs.
##
Explain "No Load/Full Load" of a engine please.
##
first! and cool i was waiting for this vid. and side note where could i get 
some cheap but good coilovers
##
YOU ARE THE ONE YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND A BASIC QUESTION! An then respond with 
a stupid answer like: "submarines"
##
An Integra.
##
You talking to me?? Go sit down scrub.
##
Thanks that woud be interesting; also what tricks that are used to utilize 
airflow on the chassis etc. 
##
7:09
##
EXACTLY EXACTLY EXACTLY. A lot of people don't understand that sway bars 
aren't a good thing. Its a cheating and cheap way to reduce body roll at 
the expense of suspension independence. The perfect suspension wouldn't 
have sway bars or would have a sway bar with a clutch. 
##
you're super lucky getting all these free parts for your car, you should 
buy an expensive car and start doing more power adding mods ;D
##
why would anyone buy yonaka coils..................., and also isn't the 
bumpstop to stop the shock from bottoming out, so they dont blow? p.s. a 
12kg spring will make your back ache, i have 6.3 kg spring all around and 
they are pretty stiff, bearable but stiff
##
When are you going to install all of those parts to make a track integra 
race car ? @EngineeringExplained
##
Are they going on your car?
##
Hi, just got this idea: could you explain what is meant by airresistance 
dragcoefficient. Given also the wheelhorsepower one could calculate the 
(theoretical) maximum speed of a vehicle, right? If you could show us the 
formulas?
##
Eventually, hopefully, yes. I'd like to get into CG and roll center. 
##
Yaaaaaaay COILOVERS!!!!
##
You have a natural skill for explaining things, Great job on all these vids 
man!
##
Does it have something to do with the rotating wheel?
##
Nice comeback <3
##
"You should buy an expensive car." That part requires enough money for an 
expensive car. :)
##
can you make a video of your car, kinda curious to see what it looks like?
##
Your videos are very helpful. So a lot of companies sponser you with there 
products?
##
Email me at husker54@hotmail.com some time. I'm going into Mechanical 
Engineering this coming year and would like to pick your brain for advice 
as I would like to go automotive with it
##
It could be that the fluid, or some of it, has managed to break a seal and 
leaked out, thus making the shock absorbers of no use. 
##
We're all happy, things are going well!
##
make a video of the installation!! 
##
Alright.. you're starting to humor me more then trying to make a good 
comeback unless you have something worth saying... shut up
##
Whats your name? 
##
Side to side weight transfer or "roll" isn't that what sway bars are for?
##
Are you trying to talk?
##
99 Integra GS, I've got a more detailed answer to that question on my FAQ, 
which you can find on the "about" link on my channel. 
##
Are you.. Are you serious right now?
##
Thank you sir, Glad to see that someone else sees sense in this 
conversation!
##
So would you suggest coilovers over loaded struts? I really don't know 
which to buy! 1993 honda accord
##
Man this videos are sooooo informative, its so easy to understand, it 
doesnt even matter the fact that english is not my native language. I 
really apreciate the fact that you take the time to share your knowledge. 
Ive learned a lot from you, Im a ver happy subscriber, always waiting for 
new videos. Greetings from El Salvador :)
##
so only better solution is to get whole coilover set :)
##
Well that would be nice . Yesterday i checked 'the physics of racing" by 
Brian Beckman and read his theory about weight tranfer . I understood it 
but it should be more easy than his explanation . He used the concept that 
like he said "The braking forces create a rotating tendency, or torque" . 
and the braking objects have a tendecny to rotate over just like a car is 
trying to rotate in his nose while braking . So i want to ask when such 
weight tranfer occur the center of gravity changes right?. 
##
Can u.please explain magentic ride/suspension. Really want to know what 
makes the difference. Plz!
##
I wonder where bitches like fanargo comes from
##
Conservation of momentum. see physics 
##
thanks i learned some
##
sir, what are the lifespan of coilover?
##
Great videos. Can you do some videos on:- dual mass flywheels, variable 
induction systems and balancer shafts
##
could you do an install how to? ps thanks so much for posting videos im 
learning a lot from you! :)
##
Hey man, great video. Quick question though. Those bolts will surely not be 
tight enough to keep the bar from moving under high force. Why put bolts on 
each side when it'll just allow movement in the bar and allow less of the 
force to be transferred/absorbed? Personally, I have an OEM three point 
strut bar on the front that bolts to the firewall and has no pivot points.﻿
##
Is there an advantage for strut brace over strut mount vs. strut brace 
connecting to the side of the tower?﻿
##
God bless you for these videos!! I'm on a marathon!!!!! from diffuser 
videos, to CAI, exhaust everything man!!!! keep it up!!! so like what's 
next? seafoam explained?
##
 can you make a video explain how swag bar work 
##
i feel so stupid right now i thought those bars were to protect the engine 
from a blow i saw those bars all the time i the fast and furious movies lol 
thanks man i always learn from your videos your helping me get smarter at 
this stuff
##
While on track in my E36 M3 (was running very sticky rubber) I cracked a 
windshield after negotiating a quick right-left-right section of track...in 
video you could see the crack form and grow as the chassis twisted left and 
right. Adding a sub-frame brace and a strut bar significantly reduced 
chassis flex...I haven't broken a windshield since. 
##
I'm not an engineer. I am a retired automotive technician of 44 years. I 
used to race cars. I added a strut bar to a car I'd driven every day and 
raced after two years. After the first race, the windshield cracked. I had 
customers who installed strut bars and experienced the same. One of those 
cars was a VW GTI that, as I stated, cracked three windshields. In my 
circle of racing acquaintances, it became common knowledge that adding a 
strut bar to a car w/glued-in w/shield would likely suffer. 
##
From what I've heard﻿ 2 point strut bars do very little to stiffen the 
chassis. I believe 3 point strut bars that anchor the bar actually have an 
effect.
##
That particular car may have benefited from a subframe and frame tying 
front subframe brace. Convertibles experience this as cowl shake. Like one 
from Mason Engineering .ne t
##
Wouldn't a strut bar reduce the likelihood of a windshield failure? If the 
WS is a stressed member, the addition of a SB will reduce the amount of 
stress applied to that WS. 
##
Excellent! Except double wishbone suspensions are load bearing at the top 
also. The full weight of the car is transferred from the body to the lower 
control arms through this point in both designs.
##
Sway bars cause a much greater impact on vehicle dynamics than strut bars, 
so if done properly, a sway bar. 
##
What would be more beneficial from a general perspective (as well as if I 
was to do some autocross events). Front/Rear sway bar or the strut bar? 
Thanks
##
Good video
##
I suppose. It's likely a case by case (car by car) scenario as the stresses 
aren't going to pass the same way in all vehicles. 
##
The windshield is glue to the frame, which turns it into a stressed member. 
When the front of the car is stiffened elsewhere, it transfers the stress 
to the windshield/frame. Something's gotta give. Stress cracks that begin 
in the edges of the glass is the result. I knew one guy who went through 
three windshields. Replaced the heavier sway bar with a stock unit and the 
cracks stopped. He was one of a handful who experienced the problem.
##
"greatly increase the chances that your windshield will crack" You realize 
quite a few vehicles come with these from the factory right? The items 
aren't very connected. Care to explain the logic? 
##
Be aware that installing a strut bar will greatly increase the chances that 
your windshield will crack. I've seen it a number of times.
##
Grammar fix now commas help you
##
They all leave feeling a bit stiffer.
##
An accountant, a writer and a doctor walk into a strut bar, and none of 
them know what they got themselves into.
##
Integras dont have double.wish dey dj ot sin dj le bone only ndx n orelude 
have double wishbones
##
Likely no, you would want either stiffer springs, a stiffer anti-roll bar, 
or to raise your vehicle to fix this.
##
Would this reduce roll around a corner? I have a lowered Integra and my 
wheel rubs on a hard corner, would this reduce rub?
##
Yes.
##
do u have gray hairs?
##
I would just say make sure everything's tightened well and there shouldn't 
be much movement. 
##
Hey EE! Is it better to have the struts adjusted to be pulling in or 
pushing out? This seems to be the flaw with adjustable struts, they can 
move more than the chassis flexes.
##
on a really bumpy road you loose ride comfort since that the car is too 
rigid. my own experience I have front and rear strut bar plus a lower tie 
bar on bumpy roads the whole car follow instead that one side is affected 
since the suspension are fully connected you won't lose a lot but you will 
feel it but you got a better handling wich I like!
##
Nice vid man!
##
strut bars are great..the one in your video would not be used on a race car 
since it has two joints..as rigid static strut bar would account for 
chassis twist..like when you go around a turn or go over a bump.. good vid 
##
Possibly slightly less. 
##
Would your control arm bushings/sway bar links etc... take on more stress 
with a strut bar?
##
Minimizing flex is always a good thing in suspension. If any flex does 
occur during movement, the suspension geometry then gets thrown off as well 
thus decreasing overall handling. Good video!!
##
thanx man, good to have u im going to be askin u a lot of anoying questions
##
Actually, depeding on the suspension you use, i would affect comfort! Our 
Legacy BG5 Wagon, With Impreza GT Struts and Coils, with Front and Rear 
Strut Bars, is waaaay diferent on confort with, and without them! Anyway, i 
really liked the video!. Congrats.
##
You may be thinking of a sway bar, strut bars won't have much (if any) 
influence on understeer/oversteer, where as sway bars certainly will. 
##
If it's paired with a rear strut bar, otherwise just stiffening the front 
may induce understeer.
##
I've got a question, while discussing the potential value in a strut bar on 
a double wishbone, you bring up the fact that the shock will be compressed 
during a hard turn. Of course this is true, so it makes me reconsider your 
explanation of the macpherson strut. You explain that a hard turn would 
cause a rotational force upon the lower control arm, pulling the strut from 
its tower. What about the compression of the strut? Wouldn't it be pushing 
the strut into the tower? Good videos regardless.
##
does a bmw e30 drift better with a SB?
##
With all that momentum getting transferred wouldn't that decrease the life 
expectancy of a strut bar
##
Won't affect comfort. 
##
Strut bar is a good to have? How about the driver's and passenger's 
comfort? Does it affect that?
##
Oh true, i didn't really think of that. 
##
Oh ok. Interesting, thanks.
##
Nice video! About the rear strut bar, I think the main difference is that 
it often goes through the boot which is really impractical! ;-) Yeah there 
are people who do care about the practicality of a boot! (I'm not one of 
those do not worry! ;-) )
##
If it was noticeably negative camber, it's just for show. In all likelihood 
the handling would be worse and the tire would wear unevenly. 
##
Somewhat related; I saw a vintage corvette with negative camber on the back 
wheels. Would this camber potentially help keep the outside tire planted 
when taking a tight corner at a high speed and reduce over steer because of 
the friction trying to pull the wheel inward (therefore the tire may be 
closer to flat with the pavement in that situation than without camber)?
##
correct, to strut your stuff.
##
Correct, to increase chassis rigidity. 
##
So the function is just to share the force to the other side of the car?
##
That would likely cause uneven wear when you don't need it (ie going 
straight). 
##
So, to make up for a strut bar, you can implement two or three negative 
degrees of camber, to gain more traction whilst cornering?
##
genius I tell you 
##
your videos are great! you present difficult auto concepts in a format 
that's very easy to understand. i've learned more from you in the past few 
days about how cars work by watching your videos than ever before.
##
as for the gsr, type r, and civic si come with strut bars, the strut bar is 
mounted along the strut tower area as we all know but its not mounted onto 
the actual strut tower itself to support the struts. u have to drill into 
the tower to mount these struts. with these type vs the ones that are made 
to mount right onto the strut, which is better?
##
Probably would be best to physically connect to two strut towers, the way 
it's done with the Type r, etc..
##
I will indeed be doing this. Thanks!
##
I suppose it would be possible if they were weak enough. 
##
I'd love to see a video of you modifying your own car with all the parts 
that you've been sent. Or just an aftermath video on your car after being 
modded with the parts.
##
is there any change of snapping strut studs due to stress of cornering hard?
##
I believe air springs are much costlier. But you can alter your ride height 
in a matter of seconds rather than taking an hour or so. 
##
i like this man.
##
Nice work :) Keep posting :)
##
what are the benefits of using air springs over coil-overs? which is better?
##
I've found a new purpose to my mechanical engineering studies: understand 
properly your videos haha! Having just started, I remember oh so well doing 
moments and forces last semester... Great video by the way, as always !! 
##
Nope.
##
You're very welcome, thanks for the kind words. 
##
Excellent explanation thanks
##
excellent videos, man. some of the best. you take some intimidating stuff 
and make it very easy to understand. thanks.
##
Will it makes the car more uncomfortable?
##
or too thick of a rear sway bar. Usually people don't want to get rid of 
the oversteer in an FF platform, though, as a tad of oversteer allows the 
car to rotate into sharp angles easier, it makes it handle much better. Of 
course it lowers the stability on quick turns at high speeds. As for the 
understeer, there's so many factors: Tire pressure, tire surface heat, sway 
bar size, body roll, struts/valving, and the driver for example.You can 
make the best setup FF car push if you drive it wrong.
##
You can get stiffer spring without changing the ride height. But if you 
want to go around a corner quickly I'd look at your tires first.
##
Awesome. I love mine, haven't really started doing anything to it, though I 
plan on turning into a track car once I get another car. That's when the 
fun starts!
##
How* -_-'
##
So far Redline360 and Yonaka have been very kind to help out with videos. I 
do believe this trend will continue as long as all goes well. 
##
I believe double wishbone type suspensions allow for maintaining the 
geometry of the wheel across a wider range of travel than MacPherson 
struts, without compromising the wheel camber. 
##
do strut bars make the struts last longer?
##
Thanks for your lesson man ! That's great, However I do have some doubts 
which I hope you would clarify for me. So based on your explanation, I 
understand that strut bar connects the right and the left side strut towers 
together hence distributes the forces. But what about 4 points strut bars ? 
More contact points = more rigidity ? How would the front strut bar affect 
the understeer and oversteer ? Currently experiencing both US and OS. (FF & 
MacPerson equipped) Thanks in advance. 
##
i see a b18a 
##
awesome video! I added some bars to my old pontiac 99' grand am (boat) and 
felt an instant response with corners Struts are not to be over looked! 
##
Did you learn most of these things at university?
##
Hey I was wondering if I take off my muffler and keep it straight piped 
would it increase horse power?
##
I was really hoping you were sponsored or endorsed by a parts manufacturer.
##
Great vid
##
First question, not really. Don't know much about Bose suspensions. If 
you're referring to the "active" part of the suspension, it is unrelated to 
the strut bar.
##
Search my channel for "anti-roll bar - explained"
##
You are so awesome for making these videos. I dont understand how youre so 
nice to take time from your day to teach people about cars.. i highly 
respect you.
##
Love this chan, but my english is sometimes too bad for understand all :D.
##
I'm leaning towards an STI, but I want to hear about the new model. 
##
what ever you plan to purchase. get OBD1 enjoy every one of your videos.
##
I would be glad to take your lottery money. :)
##
No, I have a video on anti-roll bars if you'd like to watch. 
##
Do strut bars play a role in comfortability of the car? What is your 
opinion of Bose suspensions? Do they use strut bars in their 
configurations/ Thank You for the answers
##
I told you before the 99 integra LS was my first real car. I had the 
original sypder rims and everything. I ended up selling it because I racked 
up 20+ tickets like a retard but I did pretty much the same as you. My mod 
list: Optima yellow top batt. Skunk2 strut bar Skunk2 pro series intake 
manifold Venom Fuel rail Custom JDM carbon fiber intake bigger Throttle 
body... SKunk 2 as well forgot size though port 99 si head vtec frank swap 
tit. internals killer cams ect... one of my fav cars. 
##
So is a strut bar the same as an anti roll bar?
##
And recently I downgraded to stiffer shock absorbers and shorter coil 
springs, see how it goes, but still no front sway bar. Thanks for your info 
man, appreciate it.
##
so if i ever win the lottery and need someone to build my custom car, im 
going to call you first :) 
##
would you say it's worth the money to put a strut bar on a 91 Integra gs. 
It is also pretty much slammed too, idk if that matters.
##
no its not.
##
Tell if this is a correct analysis. Strut towers are connected to the body 
of the car regardless of macphearson or Double-A. However, they can flex a 
little within ( it looks like there are bushings but there will be body 
flex). This means that that the force the strut bar transfers is moresoe 
due to the rotation of the strut than any linear movement. 
##
Thanks for another great lesson! Thumbs up.
##
A triangle is the﻿ strongest shape in physics, the firewall completes that 
triangle and greatly reduces flex.
##
Correct, the MacPherson strut is load bearing of the forces from lateral 
acceleration, where as a double-wishbone handles the vast majority of the 
forces through the control arms. Of course, the weight of the car, bumps, 
and weight transfer by cornering still put additional pressure on the 
coils, thus a force on the strut tower. 
##
Anti-roll bar is a torsion bar that connects at the bottom of the vehicle. 
It works on slightly different principles. Check out his video on anti-roll 
bar in the suspension section. 
##
Can you make a video explaining how brake cooling works through a car?
##
It must feel great having big companies like that give you components, 
lucky guy! 
##
you're awesome, i love your vids!
##
Depends how much force it actually sees. As it's a double wishbone 
suspension they may be fine as is. 
##
Thanks a bunch. Cheers !
##
DC4 integra. 
##
Why OBD1?
##
haha im lucky you replied, i don't want the internet screaming at me :( 
what year sti were you leaning on by the way?
##
Can you explain the diferent kind of pistons please.
##
Btw you have AMAZING videos. Naturally an amazing explainer hahaha
##
depends on the car and u have to tune it...ur car will lose its back 
pressure when you make it straight pipe, therefore it has to be tuned. If u 
have a a ricer and just want the sound go ahead, but for real performance 
they sell kits for that called exhaust system, so that it will pass 
emissions at the same time make horsepower...i am just talking out of 
experience...anyone correct me if i am wrong...my friend made his honda 
straight pipe. sound like its going 100mph when its only doing 30.lol
##
With all due respect. WHY don't you install the parts on your car? Or do 
you feel that will under mine the channel with preferential treatment.
##
What about your master?
##
what kind of course did you take to learn al these things? was it at a 
university or or some sort of different course? thanks.
##
Thank you!
##
Check out my video "why do convertibles weigh more." It's old haha, but I 
cover the basics. 
##
So basically when you say European Suspension System you can plausibly 
think of this? To wit it adds rigidity to the flame ameliorating torsional 
forces, absorbs vertical thrust (think pothole.) 
##
Question!: So during conering, the strut bar experiences tension as its 
holding the chassis together, but under a bump, its under compression? 
Also, does a strut bar control the balance of a car? or is that a sway bar? 
And finally, i heard that strut bars are useless unless they are connected 
to the firewall or more than 2 points.
##
that last sentance makes me want to shoot his honda...Your mostly right 
though. I would personally leave the exhaust alone unless your adding a 
turbo. If you want hp on the cheap, get different tires.
##
Check out the "FAQs" link on my "about" page on my channel. 
##
Confusing, but I will try to understand! Great video! :)
##
This is my favorite channel on YouTube.
##
Do all cars have strut towers? If not, then are you boned and can't install 
a sway bar?
##
Well, you want it to be as small and light as possible, while still 
managing to link the two bars without compromise. What the perfect balance 
is, I do not know. Would have to use some strain gauges.
##
I want to make one fro my old Alfetta. You cant buy them for my car but it 
shouldnt be too hard to make. any suggestions on the tubes wall thickness?
##
and how about strut bars that also connect to the top of the firewall?
##
Amazing, thanks!
##
It doesn't act as a sway bar, it simply keeps the body a bit more stiff. 
Sway bars are used to reduce roll, which is not what strut bars are used 
for. I have a video on sway bars if you're curious. 
##
In an FF setup with MP's that's most likely coming from too tight of a rear 
end. What kind of suspension are you running and how thick is the rear 
sway? Your OS problems are most likely sway related...same for your US, 
most likely, but there's many more factors that affect that on FF..
##
No, anti roll bars connect the bottom of the chassis to the suspension
##
So with a double wishbone setup the strut bar acts as a secondary sway bar 
that links the shocks/springs together?
##
As long as the components are strong enough for the forces they see, it 
shouldn't matter too much. A single piece will likely be able to handle 
stresses better as it wont have as many sheer points. 
##
doesnt even matter. just remove bolts up top and put it on and tighten 
down. 
##
Meaning what do I have to do to fix this ? Rear sway is already there, 
optional package from the factory. I don't have the exact measurement 
however the sizes and shape are pretty much similar to the aftermarkets. 
But no front sway bar. For the suspension, I tried adjustable front and 
back but its too tight and slide out the tire, too tight I guess ? and 
during hard cornering, the tires floats ! So I added pillow ball on top of 
it, less but still. 
##
Can u do traction rods?
##
I wonder what'll happen if you don't have strut bar installed in your 
vehicle ;D
##
Because they serve different purposes. 
##
Dude you're a genius for explaining all these components so well
##
Will too stiff strut bars cause understeer?
##
I don't see it making a huge difference, unless there is considerable flex 
in the strut towers upon lowering the car back onto the ground. Regardless, 
if installed once lowered it will attempt to negate any force which differs 
from the car when it is stationary. The bar will experience compression and 
tension, so pre-loading it one direction (which could be the case if 
installed while lifted) may not always be best. Interesting question though 
- feel free to expand anyone...
##
It shouldn't affect the steering dynamics. Stiff is a good thing in this 
case. 
##
Non vtec FTW nice =)
##
if your getting sponsored now congrats man you deserve it. thanks so much 
always for making these videos entertaiing. if you were a teacher i sure as 
fuck wouldnt sleep. thanks again and keep up the good work!
##
Are you an engineer or a mechanic?
##
Not from rotation of the strut, but from forces passing to the strut 
(whether it be tension or compression). 
##
09 si, do i wanna a strut bar? worth the $?
##
It's funny who all those classes on moments and force body diagrams now 
come in handy
##
I wouldn't call it the "strongest shape in physics." If anything, that 
would be awarded to circles as they distribute stress the most evenly - 
hence the use of cylinders in many structural systems, and why you can 
stand on an empty soda can without it crushing. That said, triangles are a 
strong shape in 2d, as they don't allow for movement as easily (degress of 
freedom) like a square. 
##
Great stuff keep up the good work!
##
4 points just means the forces will be distributed more evenly, this is a 
good thing. Also, sway bars will have a much larger impact on 
understeer/oversteer - check out my video "anti-roll bars - explained" for 
more details. 
##
No I know how they work, but in the back if the bar is pushed enough on one 
side it will try to lift the other in a similar fashion to a sway bar.
##
Please do A video on water methanol please.
##
Hrm, it's difficult w/o knowing the platform entirely off-hand. Though if 
you go into any forum's (like if you have an integra, check out honda-tech 
for example, an SRT-4, check-out srtforums, etc.) autocross section and 
you'll find tons of people who know how to fix the problems on that 
particular platform. The oversteer is most likely caused by too tight of a 
rear, which can be caused by tighter valved struts in the rear (happens 
when people mis-match), too high spring rates, or continued
##
Hi, I have a question. Im driving an EG5 and something I notice is that my 
rear strut bar isnt very solid. When its mounted and I grab it in the 
middle and shake it, the bar starts to elasticly bend a bit. So the 
question is - does it still do what it is supposed to? From this video I 
assume that strut bars deal with push/pull forces only and not rotation 
momentum.
##
awesome video man. 
##
So wouldn't it be lighter to have a MacPherson and a strut bar rather than 
a double wishbone and a strut bar? If the strut bar is there then why go 
the double wishbone way?
##
What car are you saving for?
##
I did install these - the video will be up Saturday. I haven't installed 
the catback because I want to do engine upgrades differently - I want to 
prove they've made a difference, which requires dyno testing. I want to be 
able to tear apart my car and leave it in a garage, without needing it - 
which requires another car. This should all be solved within a year, as I'm 
saving for a new car currently. My channel grew a bit faster than I 
expected, so I'm just trying to keep up! 
##
Depending if you track it or not, perhaps. Basically you're just ensuring a 
bit more that the body stays as is. 
##
CAUSE I LOVE your videos so much i share a lot in my tweeter acount 
@salim77150
##
Hook up that Integra already lol
##
Well, it certainly shouldn't be very easy to bend it, but as you mentioned 
it's really only in tension/compression along the length of it. A vertical 
force wouldn't be applied, except possibly at the very ends. 
##
Thank you so much for explaining it, I've been trying to scratch my head 
over that particular part in my car even with research hardly many have 
good explanation over this. Also, does the size or weight of the bar effect 
its performance?
##
Do Caltrac bars, or or traction bars..I want to better understand how they 
work.
##
Front upper back strut bars + Lower front/back strut bars= awesome handling 
##
FIRST
##
Can you do a video on weight distribution and its significance on fwd awd 
rwd cars
##
Haha okay, I was like why do I want to go back in functionality? 
##
i would look into air suspension if you want it to be more comfortable. its 
expensive but i've heard it's worth it. 
##
Just another point to further reduce flexing. 
##
can you do a covertable stability vs cars with roofs stability and why 
convertibles aren't as stabile ?
##
Any idea about the reasoning about different mounting points for the shock 
tower bars on the integra/civic? I've been using the OEM Type R bar which 
mounts with those rubber gormets with the use of screws and nuts, whereas 
the gsr and type r have welded studs. I saw in the other video the bar you 
are using mounts on the shock mounts. And then there is the neuspeed bar 
which mounts over the upper control arm bolts. I honestl'y didnt feel any 
difference, but did read neuspeeds made the most. 
##
What about different types of strut bars? The one in your video is made of 
multiple pieces, while some cars use a single piece of metal.
##
A sway bar is a metal rod that attaches to the wheels at the hub using a 
link. The front/rear wheels are linked together in this way to when one 
wheel goes up when going over something it has to try and lift the other 
wheel with it. This is to reduce body roll or the side to side 
pitching/swaying you get after hitting a bump in some cars.
##
you will annoy people more then gain hp. If you want to gain hp you will 
have to re-do your exhaust system from the header's down. You can also swap 
out your tires for more racing ones. They warm up pretty fast and get 
sticky for max grip. I would go with tires if your ride is not turbo 
charged.
##
i thought that i new cars until i found you website, thnx man
##
In your vids, you say that the body of the car absorbs the the forces only 
in McPherson system. This is a little confusing. Since the springs are 
attached to the body, it has to absorbs the weight. I think you mean that a 
McPherson suspension transfers both rotational and linear movement. 
##
so can v say that adding a strut bar will reduce the dynamic camber gain 
during cornering???
##
Hey, not bad! I'm pretty proud of the Torsen differential drawings.
##
Is that an RSX?
##
It is possible, depending on how flexible the chassis/body is. 
##
Nope, check out my FAQs (link on my "About" page) for more info. 
##
yus please!
##
This may seem like a dumb question, but what's the best way to install a 
strut bar? Should the car be flat on the ground, all the way of the ground, 
or just slightly off the ground so there's little load on the suspension? 
Or does it even matter? Love your videos!
##
Water is cannot be compressed, so if you have water in a cylinder and it 
attempts to compress, it will fail to do so. This likely results in a 
broken connecting rod, and could cause other damage as well. 
##
Thank you, glad you enjoy the videos!
##
It's not that coveted of an accomplishment haha
##
Many companies do it quite differently - I'm not sure of what's ideal. But 
I do want to get a few videos out eventually on weight transfer and roll 
centers. 
##
Mechanical engineer. 
##
Explain c pillar bar and lower tie bar plz
##
I wouldn't say there would be a correlation, unless the strut is 
unnaturally strained from bending too much - though I'm skeptical that this 
would happen. 
##
Anti-roll bars connect independent suspension set-ups (at the control 
arms), so that when one wheel travels up, it causes the other to have a 
vertical force as well. 
##
Stock components in my 08 Impreza WRX are too soft and can't take corners. 
Would stiffer springs up the handling or does it only lower the ride?
##
You're welcome! Thanks for watching.
##
Best springs i've ever seen drawn by hands :D
##
all u need now is an intro for all ur videos! haha
##
And what's a sway bar?
##
OMG I GOT FIRST
##
Thanks, Ian. :)
##
frame O.o
##
This is my faviorate channel of all times, thanks for a great exlpaination
##
ah sorry typo, OBD2** and im sure you know why :)
##
great video man! p.s - i think that might be the best drawing youve done so 
far hah xD
##
Jason help me. lowered it with Eibach sport line, did my alignment 3 times 
since, but my car still drift to the right a lil bit.... let me know if u 
want the spec after the alignment. Thx! Max
##
true......they are damn aluminum and so thin...solid ones are the best
##
why use a strut bar instead of high performance springs/shock absorbers and 
a anti roll bars/ sway bars?
##
What you were holding in your hands is not a strut - it's garbage that does 
nothing; only solid bars like DC Sports really work
##
Thank you for the knowledge﻿
##
Could you please explain spool valve dampers? They are used in F1 and on 
the Aston Martin 177 and the upcoming Z28. Awesome Explanation BTW!
##
to keep the car from body roll even european cars since 1975 have anti roll 
bars connecting the 2 triangles, the stiffness of the anti rollbar decides 
how much the car goingto body roll
##
It reduces roll by transferring the force to the other tire, thus leveling 
the vehicle somewhat. The heave spring is for when both tires are lifted 
(hitting a bump, braking hard, etc.) it offers resistance to this motion. 
##
Your last sentence just shows that you do not understand simple forces. The 
fact that it is mounted horizontally as apposed to vertically means gravity 
is not acting against the motion of the damper. Not only will you find 
other sources that state a pushrod has less unsprung mass but if you know 
basic statics and mechanics you'll be able to show that with a simplified 
free body diagram.
##
Sorry that's incorrect your pushrod moves, your rocker moves and the shaft 
of the damper moves, so its the same as a conventional system but with the 
additional components (pushrod & rockers) moving also. The fact that the 
damper is mounted horizontally has nothing to do with removing unsprung 
mass.
##
Let's compare a conventional double wishbone and a basic pushrod double 
wishbone. The conventional set up has the damper moving up and down when 
the wheel goes over bumps. A pushrod set up has everything the conventional 
set up has with the addition of a pushrod, except that the coilover is now 
mounted horizontally and attached in such a way that only the weight of the 
pushrod (which is lighter than a damper) is moving up and down with the 
wheel. You understand?
##
It simply has to be strong enough, a 4 g load is probably no where near the 
bar's yield strength (where it would permanently bend). 
##
Correct, but the anti-roll bar acts to do the opposite, and tries to "lift" 
the left side thus keeping the car flat. 
##
man i was wondering the same thing. it seems the roll bar would snap if 
enough force was applied while cornering
##
I won't say all but yes it's a very common suspension set up. 
##
Do all formula 1 cars have double wishbone suspension front and rear? Also, 
is this suspension used in formula sheane?
##
@Engineering Explained can you explain the differences in handling & 
performance between an Fr and an Mr layout? 
##
Basically convention is that the chassis is sprung mass, and the wheel is 
unsprung mass, which is kind of simple to understand. The problem with the 
suspension is that it connects the two together so what is it, sprung or 
unsprung? The convention is to say that half the mass of the entire 
suspension system is sprung mass, half is unsprung mass. Their position 
doesn't matter to the unsprung/sprung, only the total mass, so more 
components are likely to have more mass, therefore more unsprung mass
##
How is the unsprung mass increased? There are more components involved, 
yes, but many of them (especially the heavy shock absorber) is moved 
inboard onto the chassis. What you're left with are simply the control arms 
and struts (some of which would be present regardless of the suspension 
layout). Are you saying the combined mass of a few extra members is MORE 
than a conventional double wishbone setup with a shock absorber and spring 
in terms of the unsprung mass? How so?
##
Indy and NASCAR are effectively a "spec" racing series. Formula 1 is 
nothing of the sort. Are there more similarities between the cars of today 
than the cars of the 70's? Sure. However, cost is a big reason to reign in 
the ability for teams to do any and everything they want. With the way 
things were headed, we'd have a 5-10 car grid filled with richest of teams 
as everyone else would have been priced out. 
##
Good video. 
##
Formula one is a race circuit like Indy or Nascar. What used to make it 
great and different was F1 was a manufactures race, which is to say, you 
were allowed to do pretty much anything you wanted to make the car go 
around the track faster. They are however changing that to be more like 
Indy or Nascar which are more a drivers race, which is to say, all the cars 
are pretty much the same.
##
oh ok,thats the reaction force..
##
The rocker arm is likely splined with the torsional bar inserted.
##
i am just wondering that how torsional bar is attached to rocker arm? are 
they welded together or what?
##
formula 1?
##
It would in the sketch in this video. But that's not how they are actually 
laid out in an F1 car. But if you get the spring stiffnesses wrong you can 
get the car to roll over the heave spring. So in a word you are correct, 
but, in reality they can engineer it so that it doesn't.
##
Now that you've mentioned it I do see your point on Unsprung Mass. I guess 
it really is primarily for reduced frontal area and lower COG than 
conventional setups.
##
Actually you have more components in a pushrod suspension and as the 
unsprung mass is considered to by half the mass of the moving components it 
is worse for unsprung mass, but, the packaging to move the component out of 
the air flow is the big benefit in terms of reduced drag and more efficient 
downforce from the front wing. Pullrods are theoretically better as they 
have a lower centre of gravity.
##
I thought the main advantage of a push rod suspension is to have less 
undamped mass and have all the mass in the center of the car where it gives 
a better center of gravity.
##
Conventional suspension still suffers from unsprung weight and aerodynamic 
disadvantages. Also, this is not reactive ride height. The car still has a 
fixed height which can not be altered without a pit stop. This system 
simply gives you greater bound/rebout spring tension range than a 
traditional setup can provide. But you still stuck with one setting when 
you're on the track. So you still have a car tuned for a section of track 
not the whole thing.
##
Not if the spring doesn't have a fixed point. Picture a sliding spring pack 
free to move left to right as the car leans, but which would compress when 
the car bumps or builds downforce.
##
He doesn't mention it, but these designs have other advantages. It is 
compact, meaning you can have a very low hood line. So even closed wheel 
designs will have aerodynamic benefits since they don't need as much body 
over the wheels. But mostly, it is because it reduces "unsprung weight" The 
more unsprung weight, the harder it is to keep the wheel in good contact 
with the road over any bumps. Unsprung weight reduction is why modern 
motorbikes use inverted forks.
##
i don't understand if it's for area dynamic.. why some supercar like the 
zonda uses them? it's not like the double A is expose to air flow
##
The design of the suspension is also beneficial to keep a lower center of 
gravity as well as allow for a lower profile design of the body of the car.
##
Seems to me that the heave spring and anti-roll bar do the completely 
opposite thing. So why are both of them needed?
##
Best of luck!
##
haha, thank you sir!
##
How is the rocker connected the torsion bar? 
##
is it possible for a push rod suspenion system without anti-roll bar and 
heave spring? some kind of independent push-rod suspention? i'm curious 
about the Ariel Atom front suspension... nice vid by the way... 
##
Well, I would assume there is some flexibility in the system, like in 
everyday systems. I do believe it is pretty stiff though. 
##
As far as the engine and transmission goes, I wouldn't want to change 
anything really. I would just want to upgrade the suspension system and 
brakes. The brakes would just be upgraded to vented wheel disc ABS with 3 
or 4 piston calipers. I'd also mount a low profile rear spoiler that would 
be shaped to cosmetically match the new body work and styling. Again with 
the "it's there but not overtly noticeable" approach. The body work itself 
would be done using fiberglass (yes I know it's cheap).
##
Thanks for pointing this out, and subscribing!
##
Titanium seems like a good choice, if that is in fact what most are made 
of. Not sure about the springs or calculations, but I suppose that's all 
going to be part of your research. Keep me updated on what you learn! 
##
having the components inboard also reduces unsprung mass
##
Can you please do a video of the Triplex suspension inside the Koenigsegg 
Agera? :)
##
Well explained ... you know your stuff, good going pal, interesting... 
##
I want to be a mechanical engineer when I am old enough and your channel 
will help me a lot thanks
##
I heard he was in his 20's. It's all hearsay though. 
##
I was just watching that episode 
##
Wheel does not change the angle when goes up and down so.. there is max 
traction in any case 
##
Thanks for watching!
##
Perfect
##
It is also in the new Lamborghini Aventador
##
lamborghini aventador :) 
##
Err there are no such things as "Honda-McLaren joint project", It was 
simply a Mclaren with a Honda engine and transmission. Just like how cars 
are named today - Mclaren-Mercedes, Lotus-Renault etc. And no Senna was 
never kicked out,he moved from Mclaren to Williams in 94 cause Prost kept 
kicking his butt in a much more technically advanced Williams car which had 
self leveling suspension (93) (which was later banned in 94), Senna moved 
cause he knew Mclaren couldnt keep up with the Williams car
##
engine porting video
##
This post probably would have been best as a PM. Best of luck with your 
project!
##
Thanks!!
##
Dude where do you work? Cause honestly you should be designing some sick 
cars with all your knowledge, honestly dude go work somewhere great.... 
Haha just wishing you the best of luck man!
##
I have never liked a video on YouTube before this one. Keep at it you're a 
credit to YouTube
##
Great group of videos, thanks!!!
##
Another consideration is that by bringing many components inboard one 
reduces unsprung weight so adding to the stability of the sprung mass. 
##
I actually found out what you meant shortly afterwards, but thanks after 
all :)
##
what about anti-ackermann steering geometry formula 1 uses?
##
here's a really good picture of everything 
doubleu,doubleu,doubleu.f1fanatic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/1-suspension-470x326.gif
##
tell me about it. youtube is great but this is one of the things that get's 
really frustrating. haha I guess I just have to learn to live with it
##
Not really true. There are people who like all forms of racing.
##
Great video man.. subscribed.....Do you know where i can find detailed 
information on designing the heave spring..and how it interacts with other 
two springs? thanx
##
I wonder if it is to counteract down force? To keep down force from 
compressing the suspension into the ground.
##
not to mention added traction because of more weight on the tires. This 
might be too obvious
##
and sorry about that one :) but what exactly is that ''underbelly plank"?
##
MacPherson strut, double-wishbone, pushrod and pullrod are all independent 
suspensions. I have videos on each.
##
I think another HUGE advantage you missed of pushrod suspension is all of 
the force from the road is concentrated to the center of the car, whereas 
on other suspensions, i think it's spread out to the outside. Do you agree 
with this being an advantage?
##
And Toleman
##
the antiroll bar has play in it like in street cars, how much it flexes is 
based on design, materials, and build quality. and as he says this is just 
one way to do anti roll and is used in f1 for its stiffness.
##
I love these videos. Thanks for posting. Subscribed! :D 
##
There's not enough suspension movement to need the camber gain of unequal 
wishbones. 
##
Then I want to mount a dual front splitter assembly (Basically two front 
wings an upper and lower wing. The Body work of the car itself won't be 
changed as this will all be internally done. The front end of the car will 
look somewhat different with two large openings on either side of the nose 
tip with the front lip of the car sculpted to allow smoother airflow into 
the air channels leading underneath the car. Functionally there but 
cosmetically hidden.
##
Great vid, quick question though, this setup wouldn't be very useful on a 
regular car, because it won't negatively affect aero efficiency since its 
all the same anyway right? by regular car i mean anything thats not an open 
wheel car (not the atom more like the integra haha)
##
I was one of those annoying folks that requested for this video some time 
back :) soooo... another question... if i understood it correctly, the 
benefits of this type of suspension largely points to racing i.e. not 
really practical/useful for normal road cars? which is why i only read 
about this kind of suspension on track day type cars?
##
Great video! I would just like to add that one of the other main reasons 
for push rod suspension is the unsprung mass. Since the majority of the 
suspension mechanisms are in the body, this greatly reduces the unsprung 
mass which increases the vehicle's ability to dissipate vibrations while 
keeping the setup extremely stiff as well as allowing the tires to keep 
contact with the road better. 
##
good explanation and good diagrams too - exactly how I would do it. very 
insightful and worth favouriting!
##
I want to get my hands on a stripped clean chassis of a Pontiac Fiero 
1987-88 model, cut the wheel wells out, gut out the forward subframe 
assembly (basically just clear out the entire front end) install larger 
diameter wheel wells. Reshape the frontend with large airflow channels that 
direct airflow through the front wheel wells which will be vented front and 
back and then custom engineer a pushrod style suspension system where the 
front trunk was.
##
Hadn't heard of it to be honest. Just checked out a video on it. Makes 
sense, having to alter the suspension due to high downforce from higher 
speeds, and prevent wear on the underbelly plank. Cool stuff!
##
this guy looks like Sergio perez 
##
Thanks for watching, and unfortunately no, I do not. Best of luck!
##
can i use video in my blog ? 
##
the one u can design better. 
##
Another amazing video!!!! I have 3 questions in mind though 1) Torsion bars 
are generally made of titanium due to lighweight. is there any alternative 
to it? 2) The heave spring used does it have some special qualities or 
would a regular coil spring help to do the job? 3) Calculations involved 
while assembling the suspension? Its all my research for SAE SUPRA 
INDIA2014 ( fabrication of an F1 car).
##
Right, I think it's an incredible design for the fact that it turns a 
vertical motion into a horizontal motion as opposed to other suspensions 
that simply let the car bounce up and down. I think this is one reason why 
you see the tires and suspension of F1 cars going up and down but the body 
of the car staying level. I'm not sure how to express my thought, but I 
hope I got it across clearly haha. It's hard to describe over text without 
being able to demonstrate with a drawing or something haha
##
Thank you!
##
Nice! Congratz!
##
This is great! You will appreciate your first car so much more by knowing 
how it works, rather than just taking advantage of what work has gone into 
it.
##
You're the way I learn this stuff ^^
##
So the whole idea is to design a system that works like an active 
suspension except with mechanical solution? Then why are the engineers 
still working on reactive ride height suspension, which I believe is the 
mechanical alternative for the illegal electronic version? Will a 
conventional suspension with a sway bar fitted produce the same effect? It 
seem to do a similar job with pushrod and way simpler. Anyway, what happens 
with the reactive ride height suspension? Hello... any F1 hardcore here?
##
Sure, as long as you say where it's from or have a link to my channel. :)
##
which is better? pushrod or pullrod?
##
can you do one on triplex suspension by koenigsseg
##
And with these kind of suspension you can afford to have a car with a 
larger base therefore more stable
##
Is the heave spring fixed to the body or does it just connect wheel to 
wheel? 
##
Lamborghini Aventador is the only real world application of a push-rod I 
can think of, unless you count the caparo t1.
##
What's playing on my mind is that, wouldn't the heave spring function as an 
anti-anti-roll bar (pro-roll bar)? 
##
You think Jeremy Clarkson watched this video after driving ktm x-bow?
##
Another reason for all inboard suspect
##
You didn't/forgot to mention that the pushrod suspension has a lower 
unsprung mass, which makes this mass oscillate less and thus gives the 
tyres a better controlled and more constant contact to a bumpy roadsurface 
(i.e. curbstones, etc..). But anyway great video, subscribed!
##
you should be working in a formula 1 team.....
##
Excellent video sir. Please, have my subscription :D
##
You don't need to correct yourself, there's no indication of whether the 
car is going toward or away from the camera. Great video btw, actually they 
all are, i love your method of delivery since these topics are usually 
difficult to convey through just wiki, where i usually go.
##
Yes
##
actually i have another account from 2009 but i made this this to be a 
clean new one in feb. also i'm from egypt....lol :P great to know u 
brother:))
##
Thanks! But you have not included in your Suspensions video list, so I 
couldn't find it out first. Also, you have a video on IRS vs Live Axle; 
while the video on Live Axle is titled Solid Axle, I couldn't find any 
video on Independent Suspension.
##
Interesting point, seems to make sense. I would then guess that the spring 
resistance is negligible (in comparison to the ARB) unless both tires were 
to be forced upward, where it would try to keep them planted. I do get what 
you're saying though. 
##
What an honor!! That's great to hear. Really makes me proud, and keeps me 
going my friend. Cheers!
##
The Aventador uses pushrod suspension :)
##
i too had the same question.....
##
You're welcome, thanks for subscribing!
##
Great video!! Subscribed!! Great to find videos explaing mechanical 
engineering!!
##
Hey nice video u teach better than my automobile engg sir..........btw can 
u plz create a video showing the steering system of f1 car???????? 
plzzzzzzzzzz
##
man, you gotta be the only American who understands how Formula 1 works :) 
##
Then for the rear wheels I'd basically do the same things as for the front 
end with the addition of two lower air ports on the sides of the car just 
rear of the door seams along the bottom edges of the doors while curving 
upwards by about 1-2 degrees. All of the changes to the car's original body 
work design would be subtle, mostly just a lot of smooting and rounding off 
corners, cleaning up the edges of the fenders and giving the car a sleeker 
appearence.
##
Errr Senna never drove for Ferrari, he only drove for Lotus, Mclaren and 
Williams 
##
Can you please tell us the mechanism of Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System 
##
Awsome video as usual!! Keep up the good work!
##
Hey, isn't that Ayrton Senna's F1 car there at the end?
##
Yaw moment of inertia is a good point, A bigger reason is the Lower 
Unsprung weight really helps in improved suspension dynamics.
##
Yeah I understand what you're saying. 
##
Fantastic video! Subscribed!
##
Can you do a video on the 2014 f1 engine and new kers for 2014 its called 
ers or somthing. That would be awesome.
##
Finally the interior would be redone with mostly modernization work in the 
form of newer gauges in the dash, new sound system, sat nav, custom sporty 
seats with uprated seat belts, and new steering wheel with built in airbag 
and an airbag installed for the passenger side as well. Most folks who 
modify a Fiero want to turn it into a fake Ferrari or something silly like 
that. I'd rather just upgrade the hell out of suspension, steering, and 
brakes. What do you think. Sorry about multi-posting. :)
##
Haha, may not be the correct terminology. Basically it's just a piece of 
wood (or some composite wood material) that is on the very bottom of the 
car. If it's worn more than a certain amount (meaning the car was scraping 
the ground) at the end of the race, the driver is disqualified. 
##
Me too.
##
NICE......
##
How would you describe pushrod suspension bein used in the supercars where 
there is space to use a normal suspension as well? LOWERING THE CENTRE OF 
GRAVITY AND ELIMINATING UNSPRUNG WHEEL MASS. 
##
instant subscribe 
##
this is the best explain that i ever see, congratulations 
##
Hey great video! I was just wondering if anyone here has any idea of what 
the Spring Stiffness and the Damping Coefficient for the Spring-Damper 
System are, as I am trying to work out the stresses in the push rod. Cheers
##
Haven't made it the whole way through this video yet, but wanted to thank 
you for posting it, as I wanted to learn the differences b/w push and pull 
rod designs in F1. Cheers.
##
Good vid mate. I can't help but hear ross from friends when your talking 
haha!
##
Maybe you could do a video explaining how a rising rate pull or push rod 
suspension works. Details about how the mechanical linkages cause the 
suspension to be progressive. 
##
F4 Car.. 
##
Hi, man! What do you think about the new so called FRIC suspension in F1 
(used and developed mostly by the teams of Mercedes AMG and Lotus). I 
regard it as quite intersting. 
##
Check out my videos MacPherson Strut and Double Wishbone. Both of these can 
be an IRS. 
##
Directly. I suppose there are various ways it could be done. Welded, 
splined, cast as a single piece. 
##
I understand youtube's reasoning for not allowing website posts, but 
sometimes it does get rather frustrating haha
##
brilliant, thanks man
##
That's my uncle.
##
I'm a big formule-one fan, I never understood what the difference was 
between pull and pushrod suspension so I'll have to thank you.... great 
video
##
You're welcome!
##
The Traxxas Revo chassis is a very popular pushrod/rocker type suspension 
for R/C trucks. It's been in use with many of the newer R/C trucks of the 
past decade to keep the suspension components down low for best center of 
gravity as well as allowing for insane axle vertical travel geometry and 
compactness, compared to traditional double a-arm vertical and shock setup.
##
Great explanation, mate. Isn't another *key* reason a push-rod suspension 
or pull-rod suspension is preferred in Formula 1 (and other types of racing 
or high performance cars) is that it reduces un-sprung weight?
##
@GrayFox1207 yes it is the new McLaren MP4-12C does this. It replaces the 
anti roll bar with a computer making the wheels truly independent from each 
other
##
can do you a Video about 'Snatched' Powerful 'Muscular' Start of the cars ? 
if you don't understand what I mean, search "skoda octavia acceleration" (a 
car owned by Volkswagen, with TDI Volkswagen / Audi Diesel Turbo Engine) 
this is the car with The Best "Snatch" Start I've saw (including it's 
Equivalent : Volkswagen Bora [plus Passat Models]), probably French Cars 
also have "Snatch" Start : who build also Very Nice Diesel Engines Better 
Cars DON'T HAVE THE SAME SNATCH START ! :-O I wonder Why
##
Thanks good luck to you as well
##
Reference away, that's quite a compliment! Glad to hear that they can help 
you! I took an automotive engineering course in college. Being that I had 
this channel, I figured I should do well - I made the highest grade in the 
class haha. 
##
Why is that most f1 vehicles go with the parallel wishbone setup vs unequal 
length wishbone setups? Does aero play a big role in there decision?
##
I've never done a Private Message on Youtube before and I'm unfamiliar with 
how to send one. Sorry. By the way, do you think my idea of modifying a 
Fiero's suspension is plausible?
##
Nope, I think he went on about his blissful life without a second thought. 
##
how old is this guy?
##
Another benefit to the inboard board suspension is centralized mass. The 
weight of the car is more balanced between the 4 tires making the car more 
maneuverable and easier to handle.
##
If its a hard left hand turn the body will want to roll on its right not 
its left and the anti roll bar will stabalize the car in the corner keeping 
it flat trying to eliminate body roll in a corner , but good instructional 
vid 
##
NO
##
Pretty much. The downside of this suspension type is that the wheel travel 
(vertically) distance is very small, so real road conditions couldn't be 
accounted for. But on a track, that's smooth, it's a terrific set-up. 
##
Awesome video, however I have one concern.From the geometry you described 
the anti-roll bar is infinitely stiff. Every motion of one wheel directly 
and rigidly affects the other, losing the 'independance' of this suspension 
set up. Was this intentional? Normally, a sway bar provides some adjustable 
degree of roll stiffness.Great video series though!
##
Great explanation! Subscribed!
##
AWESOME STUFF. subscribed. Dude look at the camera. :)
##
Hmm... you seem to know a lot of F1 stuff for an American, which I believe 
prefer NASCAR and drag.
##
Having the weight more central is an advantage, yes. It reduces the cars 
moment of inertia in the plane parallel to the ground, meaning less 
resistance to rotating (or turning). 
##
Thanks for watching! Sometimes I just have to admire my own artwork, you 
know? Haha, my apologies. 
##
Apologies. Ayrton drove the Marlboro-sponsored Honda-McLaren joint project 
F1 car until he insulted it and lost his sponsorship, which ultimately 
killed him in the end. And ahh yes Nigel Mansell was quite the driver as 
well.
##
Thanks for subscribing!
##
is weight distrubution another key factor to push rod suspensions because 
the shocks, instead of being located at each wheel they are in the center 
of the car giving an equal weight distrubution and a lower center of 
gravity?
##
awsum !\ 
##
If I do recall, Jeremy got to drive the Aventador, while captain slow had 
the MP4-12C to handle, while the hamster had a go at the M600.
##
Hmm that's interesting. I can see what you're saying, but that would also 
kinda make it seem more like a solid axle where lift on one side affects 
the other as well. Though it probably is best to have the suspension as 
centralized as possible (and all weight, for that matter). 
##
you are awesome!!! petrol head+ mech. engineer+ top gear fan!!!!!! much 
love man!!!! :D

Fantastic explanation there mate! The parts looked so confusing when I 
watch the engineers on TV setting up the car during practice session of the 
F1 event. Then you simplified everything thank you so much. I'm starting a 
Motorsports Engineering course this September and your tutorials will 
benefit me to aim top grades, which I should anyway since I'm a car and 
race-car enthusiast. I hope you don't mind using your tutorials as a 
reference, I assume you take that as a compliment ahah
##
I made a jalisco jumper, aye!
##
Sorry hit wrong button. Lol. Another reason for all inboard suspension is 
for less unsprung weight. Just my two cents. Good vid. Keep it up
##
please do a video on independent rear suspension. I can't find anything on 
youtube 
##
I don't think he ever drove for Ferrari. Correct me if I'm wrong. I looked 
up Ferrari's drivers for 1989: Gerhard Berger and Nigel Mansell. 
##
Thanks!
##
Crystal clear explanation. Keep it up man! I plan on being a mechanical 
engineer myself.
##
The pushrod suspension assembly in the back is where I'd expect to run into 
serious difficulties in implementation. There might not be enough room in 
the rear end for such a system as I'm not sure if the original transmission 
in the Fiero is in front of the engine or behind it further towards the 
back of the car. If it's in the front of the engine than it's doable. If 
it's mounted in back of the engine with the rear differential also at the 
back it might prove tricky with the lack of space.
##
Haha thanks, I was surprised you were able to get the username captain 
slow, and it seems your account is fairly new - cool. 
##
if the car is cornering towards the right why does the left wheel get 
lifted up?!..mass is transferred to the left wheels,so the right wheels 
lift up...
##
YAY... you just took me 3 steps closer to building my Aventador replica.. 
Thanx..﻿
##
Sooo, how much life would you lose out of an engine if you use this?
Im guessing its effective as it creates more RPM in the cylinder, so surely 
it will kill an engine with regular use?
subbed﻿
##
When you are explaining the diagram, why do you have lots of text? It would 
be appreciative if you can make things understandable for a non engineer﻿
##
You forgot about purging your lines and you can use nitrous a numerous 
amount of times, it is not bad for your engine as long as your not crazy 
and try to shoot it with over a 100hp 
I started with a dry and I think every beginner should too its easy and you 
can do it your self and don't need to tune it as much as a wet system. 
Putting nitrous on a turbo car is good kills the lag from your turbo ") 
If your going to through a tank on your car make sure to do a full tune up 
of your car first then go with a dry kit and keep it at no more than 75 
shot/ HP ﻿
##
what would happen if you could inject clean oxygen O2 instead of air or NX?﻿
##
You refill the gas. Rate is like $3.50 a pound of N2O I think. The tank and 
system is expensive though.
##
on a Subaru STI when you put into Sport Sharp the throttle position sensor 
becomes waay more active than Sport or Intelligent Drive, meaning your foot 
could be down a quarter (don't quote me on the distance its been a while 
since subie school) of the way and it will tell the throttle to go wide 
open i would probably turn the arming with into a momentary because if you 
were drag racing and your throttle was wide open and spraying will standing 
it could be catastrophic. Just thinking outloud
##
How many times can you use it? Or ida it just one use and are they very 
expensive? Thanks
##
But it can be used in tons of stock applications. Most engines (V8) can 
handle 100 hp worth of nitrous with ease. 
##
very informative! You always explain everything in great detail in a way 
that is easy to understand! thank you! 
##
would you put a turbo 0n it then ever use nirtors with a tune to make up 
for lag? 
##
Why would you prefer dry?
##
Nice vid, really enjoying learning about engines
##
ya my H2B integra loves to get wet ;) awsome videos man.
##
It's an easy, fairly cheap way to make extra power, I think it's great 
depending on the application (drag racing). That said, I wouldn't install 
it on my car unless I built up the internals for it. 
##
What do you think is nitrous systeem good or bad for your engine and by the 
way i love your channel 
##
How cn v increase hp in an old car without spending too much on performance 
parts (on a budget)
##
great job at your explanations dude....... keep up the good work
##
Sure, that's what the activation button's for. You can have it set to open 
at WOT (when activated), or some have a switch to push to activate. Either 
way, you could activate at WOT for the same effect. 
##
is there a type of nos that u can do like fast and furious and deploy it as 
u wish
##
too soon junior...
##
wet system ? i prefer a dry :) good video !
##
I NEED NOS!
##
Thanks for your explanations. Nice channel
##
how does that system work for example on a turbocharged Diesel engine? (for 
example VW 1.9 TDI PD engine) it has to be much more diferent right?
##
Thank you for explaining that to me
##
To car or to human? It is dangerous to car because it stresses the engine 
as with every power increasing modification. Suddenly parts designed for 
200hp are forced to work at 300hp and that might lead to failiure of 
weakest parts. As with every power increase life of the engine will be 
shorter. And to human: It is an anesthetic, also know as laughing gas - You 
might suffocate or pass out from too high concentration of N2O, but 
otherwise it's harmless... And fun to inhale ;)
##
@engineering explained , i have a 4.6 3v gt mustang and ive been wanting to 
spray for a while but i always hear the spraying nos will mess up the rings 
and or heads.... can you explain this more? i want to be sure before i do 
anything. thank you 
##
Awesome vids!!
##
Yes, check out the NX website if you want to look at prices for your 
application. 
##
can you buy just the n2o? if there is already a kit and if so around what 
prices would ya say i'd be looking at? 
##
isn't there a direct injection tho? 
##
What differs between power shot systems and cams systems
##
intake manifold design should be taken into consideration when spraying 
nitrous on a plate setup. A fogger setup/direct wet nitrous injection is 
ideal for dry flow manifolds, which is common on most v8 fuel injection 
engines. Wet flow manifolds have long runners which distribute the nitrous 
more evenly and can be used for 200+ shots. Wet flow manifolds are similar 
to carburated manifolds.
##
wow man, yu re awesome,,,i love love love these clips,,, i can finally 
upgrade my knowledge right here...! cheers..btw you should become a 
professor at a college automotive department...! i hope you will be one day.
##
Is nitrous dangerous?? 
##
Might as well finish off the rings and bottom end with some nitrous :)
##
I like your channel coz its useful and the way to demonstrate a clear and 
excellent
##
i should have really paid more attention in math shouldn't I?
##
he went to school and listened 
##
do a vid of a 3rd gear pull with this on the leggy
##
very useful info. 
##
Thanks!
##
I love this channel!! Awesome videos bro I've watched them all and enjoy 
all of them.
##
Check out the FAQs on my "About" page on my channel. 
##
how do u know all this?
##
Yea i guess it would do more bad than good
##
It's a Mustang kit, so no haha. Besides my piston rings need replacement 
(as well as the rest of the bottom end) if that were to happen. 
##
Is this gonna go on your integra?
##
Hi great Chanel wanted to no if its not to much of a waste of time I have a 
toyota camry v6 with a 1mzfe engine and a nos kit and was wondering if you 
could provide a recommendation on a safe nos power setting for the stock 
engine thanks
##
danger to manifold
##
Depends on what type you have, but regardless it will be fairly 
instantaneous. 
##
Do those buttons that you press to activate n20 on the steering wheel 
activate straight away or is it controlled by the ECU?
##
I have to say, every video I've watched from this channel has explained 
everything perfectly and never left me on an unexplained cliff hanger. 
GREAT JOB!
##
supercharger's when pullied down can start to become inefficient. can 
Nitrous be used to gain efficiency that is lost because of the hotter air???
##
Getting a wet system should take care of the afr, however it's probably 
best to get a tune regardless. A dry system definitely requires tuning the 
afr. Probably beneficial to tune timing for both scenarios. 
##
They go out the exhaust with other expelled gases. Also, please only post 
your question once. 
##
Not if they're built for it. But if you're planning on spraying a 4 cyl 
with an additional 200 hp with stock components, yes it probably won't last 
too long. 
##
What happens to the lingering nitrogen atom once it breaks off from the 
oxygen atom?
##
Is this detrimental for engines?
##
Really amazing videos. I always learn something new in each video, lol. 
Keep it up
##
plan to installed one very soon..assuming now my car has reached it optimal 
power with prefect afr and ignition timing..do i need to fine tune the afr 
and ignition timing if installed it on my car..tq
##
Thank you for your fast reply, ill look in to getting it all done. see how 
much its going to cost etc. 
##
Thanks, love your country!
##
I wish my teachers explain as well as you do!! Greetings from spain!!
##
You also should say, that using N2O+fuel injection (over whatever is 
normally injected) increases EGT and that hurts your exhaust valves a LOT. 
Unless you use a rich mixture and waste all that fuel. But if you want run 
rich you can justify that and just add a turbo to the car - and have a 
power advantage each day, all day long :P In other words - N2O injection is 
pointless.
##
thanx buddy for your explanation with so much points.
##
Yes, you could feasibly install a system on practically any vehicle, you'd 
likely want to build up the engine a bit to handle the additional stresses. 
##
can these be used in any car, to give more overtaking power. and do you 
need any additional modifications to support nos. thank you 
##
Vivi en Espana por tres meses y estudie espanol en colegio. Lo siento para 
la puntuacion, mi teclado es muy simple.
##
Si no sabes español, por lo menos has logrado escribir como si lo 
conocieras. Felicitaciones, me gusta mucho tu canal.
##
Gracias, ojala que puedas entender! Tal vez en el futuro tendre "subtitles" 
de espanol. 
##
Muy buenos vídeos. Saludos desde Argentina...!!!
##
Awesome Video. Keep it up. I would just like to know where does the N2O 
recover from or does it ever get finished like you use up one bottle and 
then change it
##
Your entirely wrong about the dry nitrous system. Since the dry shot 
doesn't have it's own fuel source. The car's ecm must be recalibrated and 
tuned for a safe AFR. The car's ecm will not be able make the proper 
adjustments as you stated. What will actually happen is the car will go 
super lean and melt the pistons.
##
Correct, you have to adjust for it, which is why wet systems are typically 
the better option. 
##
Yo thx for making these vids life makes more sense after I watch UR vids 
plus u make everything so simple keep it up!
##
Haha let me do u whilst u bend over the bottle ;)
##
Can you do a clip on the main differences of hall effect and magnetic 
sensors please
##
Compression, and ignition. 
##
I don't believe it is corrosive, but my chemistry is poor. 
##
Love your videos!! Keep up the good work! 
##
Man. If you can explain it for a motorcycle. I'll be the luckiest man.
##
COOL man, i watched like 6 videos now, how are you so young and smart haha, 
keep it up bud ! educating the world one view at a time ! subscribed
##
But your floorboards will remain securely attached.
##
So, since the nitros is combined with the fuel. It needs 600 amount of 
temperature. To separate nitrous n fuel which is bonded together in order 
to combust them. Question is how do we get that amount of temperature? 
Change spark plug?
##
Is it true that the nitrous is corrosive and will eat away at your pistons 
and cylinder walls?
##
yeah 
##
Is posible to instal Nitrous Kit to a turbo diesel engine?
##
would it be safe to use nos on a day to day basis as long as its set low 
##
What are the after-effects due to N2O split, with respect to engine 
emissions?
##
Damn i didnt know you get so much hp off of nitrous!! Mad
##
dangur 2 manfold
##
you rock !
##
the brass jets are what people mean when they say 50 shot or 100 shot then? 
damn you learn something everyday
##
thanks man
##
Yes indeed!
##
If what you are referring to is the purging of nitrous before a run, it 
serves two purposes. First it primes the system by clearing the lines of 
atmosphere so that you don't have a lag when you engage the nitrous, the 
lines are full of the good stuff. Second, some people do this to bring the 
bottle pressure down to what the tuner wants it to be. They do this for 
consistency as the nitrous isn't regulated so a huge pressure difference 
can cause engine tuning issues.
##
1st great video and got much info covered about Nitrous. i got a question 
for you. can you set your nitrous intake control to gear shift? if you do 
that would it give more efficiency and less weariness?
##
Awesome video man! Very informative! I'm also watching this because I use 
nitrous in Need for Speed, and I really want to know how it works in real 
life.
##
Wow, this is so entertaining x)
##
That is called "purging." It's a technique used to clear the lines of any 
air that may have built up.
##
Cool...
##
Well.. I know its a movie.. but I wanna know about the button on 1st F&F 
movie, its like a "pulse" button, isn't ? Driver press it... then release 
it... later press again, and more power again... Is that the same system 
you explained here ?
##
This guy is brilliant!! His Geeky auto videos are interesting, informative 
and your diagrams and explanations are just so great to learn from. He 
deserves an award﻿
##
Can you please do a video thats shows and explains how would nitrous work 
for carburetor vehicles. Thanks
##
I just don't understand this obsession with "tuning" civics
##
0-55 shot for 4cyl 0-75 shot for 6 cyl and 0-150 for a v8, although you 
could do as big of a shot as you like on any engine but the chances of it 
lasting longer than a few shots is unlikely
##
Then you'll spray way too much fuel. 
##
When your full throttle does nos keep going in or does it only send a small 
shot of nos
##
very educative videos 
##
99 integra, and a sad little b18b1 underneath. This will change eventually! 
##
You have the best and most interesting channel on youtube! Thank you!!
##
what does wide open throttle mean? 
##
Check out the "automotive careers" link on my "about" page of my channel. 
It's a lengthy answer so I've linked there.
##
you sir, are fucking brilliant .Your videos are interesting, informative 
and your diagrams and explanations are just so great to learn from. You 
deserve an award my friend!!
##
So much simpler than I thought it would be. Please do water/methanol 
injection and maybe intercoolers in detail. Would like to hear your 
thoughts on water intercooler spray as well. Cheers!
##
Thanks, great to hear.
##
thanks for explaining the working clearly and it is easy to understand 
##
You'll have to find somewhere that fills N2O, yes, you have to pay for it.
##
save your money sell your shitbox buy an FRS
##
or even how wings and such impact downforce ( what downforce exactly is.. ) 
etc
##
Depends on the shot you run. The general rule is a 50 shot (wet) is safe on 
basically any car and there's no need to change timing. If you approach a 
100 shot, you need to kick back your ignition timing a couple degrees, and 
any more you need to retard by a degree each time you increase your shot by 
50hp. A stock block is usually safe around 100-150 but that ALL depends on 
the engine.
##
very nice explanation thank you 
##
Isnt is possible to get more than 200 hp if you used largest N2O jet and 
smallest fuel jet? 
##
Holy crap, it adds that much. Sheesh!
##
to get more hp frm turbos, u need to increase boost pressure. and to 
increase boost pressure to a high value, u need to get forged parts.... can 
any stock car get 200 more hp ?
##
Explain a bottle warmer
##
Y U NO USE METRIC???
##
Man I've been learning a lot reading in mags and online but sometimes its 
alittle cconfusing its mutch easier having stuff explained
##
Man I learn a lot from you.. Thanx and keep posting
##
what does that mean? you're lucky that hundred shot of nos didn't blow your 
welds on the intake?
##
so what does the nitrogen do if the oxygen splits and combusts in the 
combustion chamber? 
##
Cuz dis is murica 
##
usually around 55 but you could go higher, but at that point you are 
putting long life and reliability on the line, if its a built 4cyl engine 
with say 10k in the engine you could probably do a 200 shot
##
If a quick car is your only goal, $25k can go a lot farther than an FRS. 
Though I do love those cars.
##
Bottles are for babies and its extreme on internal engine parts.
##
You should use NOS its better than nitrous express
##
There are chipsets you can use that will increase your hp. You can also 
raise your compression ratio a little to generate more power per srtoke and 
delay your ignition to have the piston move downwards with higher force, 
thus generating more power. You can still increase your turbo pressure a 
little without changing any parts. Also reducing your car's weight is a 
good way to increase your hp/lb ratio which is good, Of course all of this 
will shorten your parts longevity.
##
If you dont mind me asking what car do you drive? and whats under the hood? 
you seem to have alot of knowledge about this stuff
##
I've got videos on turbos, search my channel or check out my forced 
induction playlist. Cheers
##
just curious, where do you find reliable sources? thanks :)
##
hi i cannot use air filter in my bike bcz its losing throttle after half 
turn sometimes before half and at full throttle it stutters
##
I have learnt so much spending an hour or two watching your videos. Great 
job. everything is explained very clearly.
##
You should make a video to explain Direct port Nitrous injection!
##
I suppose it depends, but perhaps not. If the diesel typically injects 
multiple shots of diesel, it may not work the same, but maybe it could be 
altered. Regardless, concentrated O2 is a bit dangerous, as it reacts very 
quickly with a flame source, where as N2O is a bit more safe. 
##
Well if you're going for the most power it could be done with either form 
of forced induction (and the many options within). You'll want good tires 
as well. 
##
Good video; I just will never use NOS in any of my track cars. It ruins the 
engine from the inside out and it stinks when your flying down the track...
##
Yes, it can be activated by a button/switch. Probably doesn't have to be at 
WOT in this case, but why would you not be at WOT and use nitrous? Purging 
is done to remove any gas from the line, so that right up until the 
injection point the line is filled with liquid. 
##
F&F <3
##
Why is it that some systems have to spray the nitrous before it's used? How 
is this done?
##
Hey I'm in the same boat, learning mostly from online (and Forza is great 
too). Glad to help you learn!
##
Man thanks ^~^ now i know how it works
##
Glad you like it!
##
My current ccar I'm interested in is the Subaru WRX
##
i see, well the reason i'm asking this is because i tried releasing some 
pure oxygen into an older engine (carubrator) and it's idle revs went up 
for about 1000rpm more than normal, and since oxygen helps with the fuel 
combustion, i believe it's logical that if the ignition timing is set 
right, it would also bring up the HP of the car, and it's cheaper than 
NOS.... 
##
You have the best channel on YouTube, period.
##
Do they say that? Haha something tells me your F250 wasn't meant for 
racing. Diesels are definitely something I need to dive deeper into at some 
point. 
##
does nitrous shorten engines life?
##
So, Nitrous is used to increase the ammount of oxygen in the engine, which 
allows you to increase the ammount of fuel you can burn. Overall you get 
better HP, but can you use better quality or a different kind of fuel to 
increase HP? I would like to see you cover something on this topic. Did a 
quick search on wikipedia for "nitro" and it showed nitrometane as a 
high-preformance fuel. This is all fascinating for me, I know nothing about 
engines and you explain everything really well. Great job!
##
99 integra
##
What would be the difference if I use pure oxygen bottle (like the one from 
the co2 welding apparatus) instead of NOS ? 
##
Do you know what's the difference between this system where the button is 
actually a system switch for on/off, and the fast-and-furious 2 button 
setup? Or is the two buttons setup just a lack of knowledge from movie 
writers just as the "double clutching" in F&F 1?
##
ok dude :) 
##
or do you mean how long a tank will last on a 4cyl, if thats what you are 
asking, you could probably get around 12-16 10 second shots if its a 55 
shot and using a 10 lb bottle
##
What's a safe amount to run on this set up with a car that has 400 Hp so 
when it hit it does blow anything even over many uses
##
How do you know this ?! THANK YOU SO MUCH ! you somehow figure out a way to 
explain such complex things in fantastic details, so simply. Thank you !
##
I really like to watch your videos, I am a car enthusiast and almost all my 
questions are answered by you. I'm also a Mechanical Eng'g student in our 
local area.
##
Wrong. Nitrous won't cause flames and there are no additives other than 
sulfur for detecting leaks (scent). They aren't running lean (or they would 
blow the engine quickly) and they aren't running rich enough to shoot 
flames. Flames are strictly from antilag/timing settings or excess oil/fuel 
making it out into the exhaust in many different possible ways. Don't post 
things if you don't know what you're talking about haha no point misleading 
people.
##
My brain continues to grow! 
##
Can you make a video on the LFX engine?
##
the movies have a special additive on the NOS system to do that. Normally 
you wont ever see that. Your ECU will compensate either by leaning the fuel 
or riching it up pending on what it sees by your O2 sensors.
##
They have universal kits, this is a specific kit for a Mustang, but they 
would have kits that could work with your car. 
##
I get how the nitrous is injected when it the gas is at full throttle, but 
is their like a button or lever that can activate the system when you want 
the nitrous to be injected? Like in the movies on the steering wheel. Also, 
does nitrous have to be injected at full throttle? Lastly, what is purging 
the nitrous lines? Thanks! :)
##
Yeah I'm only kidding. It's quick for a truck. Its basically a diesel 
version of the raptor. I need to upload some videos
##
It's there to prevent pre-detonation intially, and serves as a molecule to 
store the oxygen with. 
##
Good work man! I watch all your videos.. keep it up!
##
Correct mixture YES but you'll need to retard your timing when spraying.
##
I suppose you could call NX and see what they think. 
##
Well, you can't just add 200 HP to your engine right without something 
breaking right? You'd have to mod your engine somehow to handle all those 
extra ponies? 
##
Yeah, that would literally DOUBLE the output of my GTI.
##
nitrous oxide injection only lasts for a few seconds, you don't need to 
modify your engine..
##
I hear ya. I know I don't have anything related to cars on my channel. I 
mainly just watch and comment with this account (only one I have). But I am 
not a big fan of drag racing. Huge though with rally/drift and some touring 
car racing. I have a long way to go in the industry but I am willing to do 
what's necessary. Good to meet you though and get some info on something I 
know little of. I also think the movies portray N2O the wrong way like The 
Fast and The Furious movies.
##
It's based off of what I have learned from people who have used it. I 
personally will never touch nitrous for my track cars. I will how ever us 
liquid nitrogen connected to tiny nozzles at the inter-cooler, radiator, 
and oil cooler to help the engine perform much better. Have you used 
nitrous? and if so, what do you think the pro's and con's are? would love 
to hear your opinion on it. I like talking shop with fellow gear heads :)
##
How do you refill your n2o can? Do you have to pay for it, or just like 
need for speed they fill up automatically?! LOL
##
Haha we still have 2 liter bottles, which is common in stores. But if you 
were to ask someone to translate that in gallons, they probably wouldn't 
know. Our unit system is broken. 
##
I'll accept your comment as an award, thank you sir!
##
Likely, yes. This system is specifically for the Coyote 5.0L.
##
Great video. 
##
even with 10k under the hood there is always room for 100-200 more hp
##
is it possible to put nitrous in a stock 95' nissan altima?
##
As you use nitrous, it lowers the bottle pressure (optimal is 1000-1050psi) 
therefore a bottle warmer will: a.) quickly warm up the nitrous to the 
desired pressure before a race b.) keep the pressure steady as you use it 
up.
##
There's not really an answer to this question. Just depends how overbuilt 
your engine is I suppose. If an engine is optimized for it's power (which 
properly engineered engines will likely be), and has a low factor of safety 
for stresses, then 200 extra hp could do a great deal of damage. Just 
depends.
##
just make sure you dont blow the welds on the intake, or else you'll have 
to replace the piston rings as well
##
Wouldn't work for many many reasons. To keep nitrous liquid it needs to be 
in a pressurized container, any area that isn't liquid (space) will be 
gaseous nitrous. The two liquids will have different densities (they likely 
won't just mix). Could get gaseous nitrous in your fuel line...
##
Do you have a video haha?
##
Direct port dry shot is how us ghetto ppl do it. Haha, its actually just 
the quick and easy way. I just drilled a hole into my intake, ran the hose 
to it, hit the button, and viola! Easy peezy lemon squeezey!
##
ya iv got a question can one mix hydrogen peroxide commercial disinfectant 
to gasoline and get extra boost or power ?
##
Could you do a video on meth injection?
##
Wonderful explanation .. your really specific in information .. what kind 
of studies do i have to study to work in this type of engineering system .. 
mechanical engineering or Just Car engineering ?
##
What is the standard volume of N2O per shot in the 4cyl?
##
can you use nitro on a diesel engine? 
##
How old are you?
##
Like purging the nitrous system before use! 
##
Any side effects? 
##
I believe so yes.
##
How much did that nitrous oxide system cost?
##
@EngineeringExplained Thanks, I'am a first year apprentice mechanic working 
for Nissan Australia. Your channel has helped me learn so many things and 
has given me a much better understanding of cars :)
##
QUESTION: Knowing that the system only works when going full throttle, does 
it stop when full throttle is released? More specifically, What happens if 
you're driving a manual and you have to change gears? Does the Nitrous keep 
going until empty regardless or does it switch off once open throttle is 
released? 
##
get that baby fitted to your Integra :P
##
And greetings from germany! Your channel is awesome. As an engineering 
student myself I love watching your vids
##
My advice would be to find out what they can really handle, and go from 
there. Never hurts to overcompensate for better reliability. 
##
u have to pull mad skids, then the nitrous fairy comes and fills it
##
Correct!! Oxygen is far more combustible at pure form; it's often 
surprising how quickly it can expand with just heat added alone and it 
doesn't combust The Nitrogen acts as a mitigant for the Oxygen so to 
control the precise amount of combustion you need in the given system. 
##
How likely is adding 200 extra hp, even shortly, to damage your engine?
##
I don't know how overbuilt engines are, but there probably are some out 
there that could handle it, at least for a while. I certainly wouldn't 
trust my own car with an extra 200 hp with no modifications. 
##
which one is that? one for a civic hatchback.
##
Fuel types is a good idea of a topic to cover, good suggestion. 
##
its quite obvious you arent in north america, there is some 600-1000+ hp 
street cars 
##
Why isn't pure Oxygen injected?
##
Sounds good man. At least you're working towards it, it's annoying when 
people with no clue come on these comments and bash things they don't 
understand haha. You should look into a 50 shot for drag racing, you'll 
learn quickly when you do the build (takes 2 days at most). And 50 is very 
safe.
##
Do they make tb plates to fit all vehicles? How do you know how much you 
can safely run?
##
hes saying that much nitrous would blow your welds on your intake
##
So how does it destroy an engine over multiple uses?
##
Thank you for taking the time too make this video. Very informative.
##
i have a stupid question: in real life,when you use nitrous,do flames come 
out of the muffler like in need for speed or the fast and the furious??
##
I have that on the to do list. That said, the to do list is quite long. I'm 
hoping to eventually have a "quick lessons" playlist which has topics like 
this, which take relatively shorter amounts of time to explain. 
##
what car do you drive? by the way your videos are great. keep them coming! 
##
Thanks for this great video, question.... When installing a Nitrous kit 
what are the critical adjustments and conversions must you do to your 
engine so you don't destroy it? Thanks.
##
Thanks for the explain. I learn something. Keep up the good work!
##
I like how you put the power of the corvette in context. What is a sports 
car without comparison. Compared to several other automakers the corvette 
pwr plant us unimpressive & sad to say behind the times tech wise. I'd like 
to see GM put their best foot forward but they seem too hung up on 
tradition. Porches Honda/Acura seem to easily extract more HP/Ltr. What's 
with that.
##
Thanks! Your name is extraordinarily long!
##
In my visit to Cuba I discover that many cars were "costumized" with disel 
engines just to save $on fuel. 
##
welcome to sheldon cooper presents fun with flags =D
##
If you do a vid on a wet/dry fogger you might want to get the NOS brand of 
nitrous
##
It doesn't hurt to build up the engine a bit. 
##
Probably a stupid question but, FRS?
##
Whatever the weakest components are (pistons, rods, crank, etc.). I know 
that's a blanket statement but it varies from engine to engine. Some 
manufacturers use high factors of safety for their components than others - 
and typically they'll cost more. Just depends on how good your internals 
are. I'd recommend reading up on forums of what other people have had 
success with with your engine. 
##
Well explained! I can see your hard work! Well done :)
##
the gallon is broken down into quarts, pints, cups and ounces. drinks in a 
bottle are usually in metric-1 liter (yeah, we have to spell everything 
differently) or 2 liter, or 500 or 750 milliliter, OR 12, 16, or 20 ounce 
(oz) bottles. there is no standard. your example doesn't translate to any 
size...about 11 ounces. A foot is an official measurement because it is 
about the length of an adult male foot. and 12 (inches) breaks down well, 
6, 4, 3, and 2. calenders, clocks, inches all use 12.
##
I would contact NX to find fittings, they have universal kits. And it's 
hard to know how much you can safely run, but they may be able to provide 
insight there as well. 
##
Glad you think so, thanks!
##
Umm no this is the internet.did you know that there a are other countries 
in the world? and did you know that they have internet? I dont understand 
you people. how can a foot be a official measurement unit? and how do you 
buy drinks? are they 0.0871 gallons?
##
How do they calculate the power gains for the n2o system? It doesn't vary 
from motor to motor?
##
At lower temperatures, air is more dense, hence it has more oxygen by 
volume - that's the idea of creating more power with the same volume of 
air. It assumes the percentage of oxygen in air is constant, but there's 
more when air is more dense.
##
Very welcome!
##
can stock pistons take N2O? i heard my stock pistons are designed for max 
120horses. now i have about 100horses... need your advice...
##
What would you recommend for a racing car that would own. What is the 
fastest? All Motor, Turbocharged, or Superchared?
##
how does purge work ?
##
Well I just check many many sources, and try to pick out what information 
seems logical. If it's been repeated enough, and seems logical, it has a 
decent chance of being accurate. Though my videos aren't without errors, of 
course.
##
Very good. Classroom type learning instead of redneck nitrous backfire at 
the track :)
##
Increasing temps and pressures has this effect, yes. 
##
Very interesting and informal videos, thanks!
##
can you plz explain how quadrajet carburetor works 
##
Is it possible for a car to explode the way it was shown in Fast and the 
Furious 1, eclipse scene? Nice video, it's great how this company gave you 
resources to make your videos even richer. Best regards. 
##
Can you please explain twin scroll turbos or variable turbine geometry in a 
future video? 
##
My question what is the timming of the vehicle has changed and dp u add 
more timing or less. And also please explain why its important to also 
check the temp of your plugs when using n2o
##
Very informative channel keep up the good work! I was just wondering, I 
know this is old school but did you ever have any experience with the 
Oldsmobile 350 diesel engine? I am an old car buff and I always thought it 
was an interesting concept GM had. Putting diesel engines in full size cars 
in order to give them more "power" and decent fuel economy. Despite 
disastrous mechanical faults. I was just wondering if you ever heard of or 
dealt with these engines and what your thoughts were on them.
##
Yeah just cover anything electrical. I covered a few connections, my 
battery, and alternator and washed the burnt oil off my engine not too long 
ago. It was fine, but I've heard many horror stories so be careful. 
##
The 2011 engine is honestly quite a device. To anyone in the used car 
market thinking of buying a Mustang, put that into your consideration. Not 
impressed with any of the engines prior to 2011. 
##
Did anybody else upon first glance think it was a penis on the board behind 
him? No offense intended EE, I love your videos, I just found it humorous 
haha.
##
Hi EngineeringExplained, my engine bay is kinda dirty after a salty winter. 
And i want to clean it, do i need to cover up anything when spray soap and 
water on it? thanks in advance!
##
O2 cannot combust without a fuel, it's not a flammable gas but it is 
required for combustion to occur. If more oxygen is present, nearly 
anything around it can suddenly act as fuel. 
##
I searched a lot but cant find please help me to know about fuel injection 
in petrol{SI}(not CI)engines,,,,,, i am from India and the bike having it 
is pulsar 220 dtsfi kindly reply me in a way that i can 
understand.......... By the way i have watched almost all your videos they 
really have stuff in them 
##
I have goals of doing so before my final days :)
##
does this type of fuel system applicable for bikes.and racing cars.... 
##
Since your done can I has that kit?
##
NO. Oxygen is not flammable. The flammable is the CH4 which is the fuel. 
The fuel need Oxygen to change state. From CH4 plus O will turn to CO2, H2O 
and heat. the rocketships uses H2 and O to form H2O and this still cause 
heat to create and still pushes the rocketships fly. basely the heat is the 
one that cause the rocketships to fly.
##
So I greatly appreciate the break down in these systems, and look forward 
to seeing your other videos. I am an EE, so these systems are a bit 
foreign, but I do not think they are beyond my grasp. So QA time. What is 
the risk to overflowing the NOs? Are you looking at overheat, and cylinder 
explosion? Is that the reason for the different intake nozzles? Is it so 
you can help control the inevitable damage that you will be doing? Or are 
current cylinders typically designed with this in mind?
##
i have Nitrous in my Pontiac Grand Prix GTP. and ive put over 25 bottles 
through my car and with a good safe setup and you know what your doing its 
a GREAT power adder!
##
Backfires are more likely to happen in 2 instances...1. morons that don't 
use WOT switch and 2. dry kits. On a dry kit you are relying on your MAF to 
make SURE your injectors send more fuel. Either instance, too much N20 and 
not enough fuel=boom boom. Hope that helped.
##
No I didn't, I just thought back to what you'd said about it while watching 
this one.I debated my bro where I'd claimed that European performance 
vehicles have more HP/LT. than GM performance vehicles. The pwr that a 
Porsche or BMW can extract per liter is outstanding. I also have a Z1000 
kawaski & it puts out about 130+hp. That's a whole other can of worms. I 
can talk aboutthis stuff all day. Or listen. 
##
Flooring it, the throttle is fully open.
##
Haven't heard of this model, no. But I am aware of the days during the 
70s/80s when the big American companies thought it was a decent idea to 
swap fuel delivery systems on gas engines to diesels without much work on 
the internals, resulting in terrible diesel engines. Probably played a big 
role in why so many Americans just avoid diesels. They're much more 
efficient engines. 
##
I've heard that Nitrous is bad for your engine. Some people have said that 
it will pretty much destroy your piston. Is this true? Or does it depend on 
your setup??
##
nah you get more than one shot out of a bottle. Depends how long you spray 
the juice for haha. 
##
r u gonna put that kit in ur Integra?
##
It's a shaft that is on the bottom of your car and it connect to the 
transmission then to either a transfer case and or differential. If ur car 
is a front wheel drive it won't have it
##
what about a video on "chirping to 2nd, 3rd, and the rare 4th gear" I have 
an idea as to what it is but not sure how/why it happens not to mention 
that I've heard it is bad for the clutch.
##
At wide open throttle the car is in open loop and will (in most systems) 
ignore the O2 sensor. In a standalone system, you can add extra pulse width 
to your injectors during ( WOT && nitrous system on)
##
yes, search my channel for diesel vs gas
##
Yes. Thank you so much for responding! :)
##
Good guy NX :D
##
Great vid. Can you also discuss nitrous systems being used to spray 
intercoolers?
##
I was hoping in the video you would have discussed the trade-offs with 
having nitrous such as the potential damage and increased wear you can put 
on your engine. 
##
Great vid as always! Thanks a lot
##
Love the videos, so much detail. makes me wanna go to school to become a 
engineer.
##
They say that the rate of pressure/heat rise when using N2O is higher than 
when using forced induction (resulting in increased bearing wear). Why is 
this?. 
##
Your like, so smart
##
Haha, you've found a great channel for accomplishing that! Thanks for 
subscribing!
##
so bro you are asking about gasoline direct injection engine. actually in 
GDI a special type of injector inject petrol under high pressure about 2000 
psi directly into the combustion chamber rather than the intake manifold. 
here common rail fuel injection system is used and the fuel is injected 
during the suction stroke at an angle 60 degree of the crank travel after 
TDC.
##
Worse, because the nitrogen prevents the oxygen from igniting too early 
(before the spark) from compression. 
##
Probably would have pre-ignition.
##
I really hope to see a video why nitrous would be dangerous to an engine.
##
I'm pretty set on the STI; should have one within the next couple years. 
##
I suppose so. it'd be similar to installing directly to each intake port 
(which you could also do).
##
a 200 horse power increase in an engine that produces less than 200 is an 
easy way to destroy it, right?
##
A few quick points: -Most ems' and very late model advanced ECMs *can* do 
closed loop fuel control at wide open but 99% of ecms and aftermarket ems' 
will NOT do closed loop at wide open throttle. they're running off of 
pre-tuned maps for fuel/spark tables which is "open loop" and must be tuned 
accordingly. -most n2o kits on efi motors are injected via a single nozzle 
before the throttle body. the high velocity n2o hits the fuel stream and 
atomizes it so you get a fuel/n2o fog
##
Assuming it was designed to handle less than 200 hp, yes. 
##
So are you going to put that on your Acura? And @christails he has made a 
video for that, and it is a good one!
##
@sillystring: I think it will stop injecting once you release throttle 
because the sensor ist the only information (except the position of the 
switch) your system gets. Therefore the injectors wont get any power supply.
##
nos always appealed to me but ive feared blowing up an engine with the 
system. Id love to have it in street applications but it seems like id get 
in too much trouble with it...
##
can you do a video explaining HP/Torque and RPM graphs or curves?? thanks!
##
*parts, not videos
##
i know it looks cool =D especially when coming out of the nose of a Skyline 
*cough*Brian*cough*
##
Really good video. I had no idea or interest in how an engine worked, then 
I watched one of your videos. I'm hooked. You explain it so well. Thanks
##
There is quite a few actually. Simplest one probably being : If you want 
too much horsepower (basically : to much pushing on your cylinders) you are 
going to blow up your engine. But that probably doesn't happen much. Mostly 
the problem will be that your fuel system will need to be able to supply 
the amount of fuel that you are asking.. If it cant you will run "lean" and 
this is bad for your engine. Really bad.
##
Bravo sir! keep them coming! 
##
I agree! It'd be great if more companies would send me videos for 
educational purposes; many thanks to Nitrous Express! 
##
I had no intentions of installing it on my own car. We discussed which kit 
would be best for a video and this is what we ended up choosing. 
##
I'm sure it varies by state as far as having it active while on the street. 
##
Is nitrous legal in America?
##
Land of the free!
##
Hey I know this is probably a dumb question but I really wanna know, what 
strand of study did you go into university for. I'm 15 and I really wanna 
do the same thing. Btw amazing videos they just keep getting better and 
better :)
##
So would this system be fairly similar on a carburetor? 
##
It would be great if you would do more videos like this where you get to 
show us the parts and how they work! Love your videos!
##
Hey, i have a doubt... a turbo works in a slimier manner right? i.e. it 
lets in cold air into the cylinders so it will produce more power... so can 
i install a nitros kit into a diesel engine which is turbo charged? will i 
need to replace any parts of the engine like, intake manifold?
##
The system I showed would be very similar, yes. Replace every time I say 
"throttle body" with "carburetor" and the video would basically explain it. 
##
Thanks, that explains a lot. Also, you should explain methanol injection. 
Or is it methane? Whichever one it is, I can't remember but you probably 
know what I mean.
##
Can you please do a video about wheel spin? I always hear F1 commentators 
talking about it but I don't understand what it is. If you could, I'd 
really appreciate it! I love the channel, by the way. :)
##
Your videos are awesome and I appreciate you taking the time to make them. 
I am a car guy and a gear head. Sure I admit most of my knowledge comes 
from research online, Forza Motorsport :) and car meets. I have applied 
your videos to the cars I've had : 98 Celica, 99 BMW 323i , and Ford 
explorer sport trac. Its awesome to see things and get a better hands on 
explanation. Thanks man!
##
Would it blow a stock 5.0 in a manual mustang?
##
The one with the most power and best traction. 
##
Hi, thanks for the video. Is it possible to run NOS on diesel cars like 
VW/Audi TDI models?
##
This was great & informative. I have a 2011 mustang & it's nice to see from 
your description than the engine was made with nitrous in mind. I stretched 
for that one.
##
It's totally legit, because you can decide between using a WOT or a Push 
Button to activate it. 
##
sooo does nitrous lower your engine's life expectancy?
##
How long would a tank of nitrous that big last for? And just to make sure 
is the nitrous being used only when a button is pressed like in the movies 
or is it constantly being used during driving unless its armed off? Thanks 
and keep up with the videos!
##
NX offers nitrous controllers that will monitor TPS signal and the 
controllers are programmable to start bringing nitrous in at lower TPS 
values. If you have no way of monitoring the throttle position (such as 
with a controller) there is really no good consistent way to do it. You can 
put it on a push button like you see in most movies, that is always an 
option.
##
would work untill you run out of n2o and then you would over heat 
##
Swap out the camshaft for a new one, with higher lift and/or higher 
duration. I should have a video up eventually. 
##
yes.
##
Our systems start at $399 
##
Please explain how he Vortec engine works?
##
Reminds me of the old The Fast And The Furious :)
##
So basically, Nitrous are more efficient than turbo/superchargers because 
you can control when you want extra horsepower and you can also control how 
much added horsepower you want? The only negative will be running cost 
(having to buy a new nitrous bottle when the old one runs out of nitrous)??
##
@EngineeringExplained so bring it to my house ill ghetto it up so it'll 
work without extra parts
##
more hp = higher cylinder pressure and temp
##
can you please make a vid about nitrous purge,what is it how does it 
work,what it does? thanks!
##
why would anyone want to use the smaller nozzles? is there any 
disadvantages to the big ones versus the small ones? other than the level 
of hp
##
Perhaps he's thinking in terms of efficiency. Could nitrous injection at 
lower revs give your motor more miles per gallon? I imagine the Nitrous 
Oxide tank itself would have to be larger, and you would probably be 
spending more money on N2O than you would for just gasoline, but would 
overall efficiency of the engine increase?
##
Since the fuel and nitrous systems are now working together and fixing the 
ratios of the two liquids being sprayed instantaneously, does that mean the 
engine won't run properly when you run out of nitrous? It doesn't really 
sound practical to have to have some NO2 just to make your car go 
(especially if the system uses more NO2 than fuel due to the larger 
nozzle). Can you shine some light on this Jason? 
##
dude ur from which country becoz ur simply super.........?
##
Purge kits were designed to relive the pressure in the bottle to get it 
back to optimal operating pressure, as well as to purge any air from the 
lines. Plus it looks cool! :) 
##
No worries, I am an auto tech in training. So I am still learning. My 
eventual goal is to be on a pit crew with either a rally team or drift team 
plus being a ASE certified master technician. So if someone knows more then 
me I am all ear's to learning! I just love automotive mechanics.
##
Would adding a pure oxygen system be better than nitrous?? Having the same 
set up but instead of nitrous have pure oxygen.. Would that be better or 
worse?
##
dude why are you on youtube you should be working on advance cars right now!
##
I'm well aware, but petrol and diesel costs almost twice as much as it does 
over there, add taxes and maintenance costs on top of that plus the high 
price of cars and te economic situation altogether and the last thing you'd 
want would be serving gasoline to a dinasaur ;) We have more than a few 
diesel cars reaching 180mph with 300hp or just a bit more, and that's with 
a 2.0l 4cyl.
##
Can you make a video on turbo? Or turbo systems? I would like to learn more 
about turbo :) I think you had a post saying you might do one turbo vs 
supercharger.
##
I likee and appreciate you videos. Very educational. I looked at videos 
that you already posted but did not see any regarding e85 fuel. Can make a 
video about e85 fuel please. Thanks.
##
I believe you can set the duration, and this can last up to 10 seconds or 
so.
##
Just some additional notes: Most EMS's don't use O2 feedback for the level 
of fuel correction in a dry kit - it's too much of a correction and it 
could be too late for your motor to even correct if it relied on it, it 
typically has to use a modified or different EMS, but most EMS's (even 
stock) aren't even running closed loop at WOT. The EMS has to be made aware 
of nitrous. You can use triggers and the GIO pins on most standalone units.
##
nice hair cut
##
Likely would cause knock. 
##
Nitrous: One of the greatest Invention of all time. ps. did you install the 
kit on your car, if so how do you like it? btw, awesome video as usual.
##
Yes, you'd probably want to replace some internals. 
##
what are the dangers of a nitrous system? 
##
Are you going to put that Nitrous on your car?
##
Yes, it is, but mostly the type R for it's incredible chassis. Not sure 
what the differences are chassis-wise between it and my ls. 
##
Will feeding the Air Intake with pure Oxygen (say from an Oxygen cylinder) 
do anything?﻿
##
why dont you do an integra 'engineering explained' video? isnt it one if 
the most beloved fwd cars?
##
could you explain what a nitrous purge system does and why it they exist? I 
would appreciate any expansion on this topic. I am a huge fan of your 
videos, you do a great job explaining things.
##
On cars using intercoolers to cool charge air, do you think this negates 
the need for an intercooler? I see many dragsters run nitrous without 
intercoolers. I guess less piping means less lag, also probably lighter....
##
Can you explain the meaning of "cammed" please and thanks
##
not only that: pur oxygen would be dangerous, a leak would be a serious 
treat of fire. Also, pur oxygen would not remain liquid in the line between 
trunk and motor, which means liquid nitrous contains more oxygen than pur 
oxygen in its gas state. Not 100% sure about that last claim, it still 
makes sense from a theorical POV.
##
It's for a Mustang, I drive an integra. I'd need some extra parts. 
##
Thermodynamic. Take water for example, you should already know you need 
some heat to boil it. It takes some energy to increase temperature up to 
the boiling point, then it takes even more energy to make a state 
transition (liquid to gas). That transition requires a lot of energy. If 
you have something that can evaporate easily (nirous), it will drain heat 
from the surrounding area, thus creating the "cool" effect. Long story 
short, evaporation needs energy and will drain it from wherever it can.
##
Before I believe. 
##
No, it's a kit for the Coyote 5.0. Thanks! 
##
I'd say none: if you can trick your ECU easily, go dry. If not, you need a 
new secondary gas line, which can be tricky to install.
##
Great video!
##
I believe the nitrogen aids in preventing the oxygen from detonating with 
the fuel before the spark. 
##
Yes but for a street car I would be happy with 200hp. Most cars in Europe 
now kick around 200hp and a bit more with 2.0l engines. Diesel engines here 
even get around 300Nm so it's good fun. As I said, we pay higher taxes and 
even more based on the emission's and engine displacement. Plus, if you 
want to have it street legal, you can't make big mods on your car because 
it wouldn't be aproved. The ones that do, only take their cars out for 
racing or have friends in the inspection center :P
##
So, what happens to the nitrogen atoms after they split? Do they do 
anything?
##
NAWSSSSSSS!!!!!!
##
No its not. Nitous Express/Dynotune/NOS are equally good and have different 
product types. ZEX is the ricey one that bases HP shots off of the crank 
and not the wheels
##
Wow you are so smart
##
Find me a position that doesn't require research on the side. :)
##
I've checked out the site a bit, kits seem to range from about $500-$1000. 
I suppose how long it lasts depends on your internals and how well you 
maintain a proper air/fuel ratio. 
##
How long will one "Nitrous bottle" take to get empty? Like 5 accelerations? 
:D
##
You could, yes, but why would you want to? I guess the logic is, if you're 
going to use nitrous, you want to accelerate quickly. If you want to 
accelerate quickly, you probably have the throttle fully open (gas pedal 
floored). Otherwise you may only make as much power as you would just 
flooring it, so it wouldn't be necessary. 
##
I would say wet since the A/F ratio can be more easily maintained. 
##
Because Nitrogen supresses the likely hood of the air fuel mixture to 
pre-detonate or knock. Having pure oxygen would likely cause the mixture to 
knock before the spark fired. 
##
Great video dude! Keep it up!
##
What other mods do u need to support nitrous? I'm guessing a air−fuel gauge 
to start with. Another good vid man thanks for the education.
##
Super video. Bravo!
##
This is actually really interesting.. and very well explained! So I guess 
the air temperature sensor wouldn't even be needed anymore, because it goes 
from just above normal atmospheric temp, to -127 F to 600+ F i guess once 
it ignites. Thats amazing.
##
which is best dry or wet?
##
Well, the nitrous cools to -127, but that doesn't mean the entire air/fuel 
mixture will drop that low, maybe 50-75 degrees cooler. Also, the 600 F 
would be inside the cylinder, so not measured by an ATS. Glad you enjoyed 
the video, thanks for watching!
##
Your videos are amazingly clear.... you should teach in a college =D
##
I bet that old civic of your kicking ass on that 1320
##
That is very interesting! 
##
87, in my prime! 
##
Woah, thanks!
##
What if you only put the jet in the fuel line? Wouldn't it just be an 
unadulterated amount of N2O?
##
im not sure how these systems work, the PSI is 50 at the output? each 
cylinder has an injector at 24-30K psi of fuel so how would one integrate 
this?
##
Correct. 
##
Would that still be a problem with diesel engines? Great channel btw.
##
Thank you!
##
PS: Very nice explanation, though :).
##
Hey dude, awesome video! one question I have a 2.0 1995 WRX impreza and 
looking to install a supercharger and nitro kit, what sort of 
considerations should I take before installing i.e. planning stage?
##
He said in the video it joins just before the fuel rail.
##
Great video keep up the good work man. 
##
That is a splice to send fuel to the N20 Plate and the fuel rail. It is not 
a line that goes to the tank, it uses the standard line from the tank and 
then splices in the engine bay (easier to install).
##
Do you have a video on 4 wheel steering ? I heard the new 911 gt3 has it 
and I wanted to understand how that works
##
Nitrous is the "sleeping gas" right? When I got my wisdom teeth removed it 
made me feel all light and tingly, it was fun.
##
How old are if you don't mind me asking? You look in 20's but your hair is 
showing some grey areas
##
Breath it! Trust me, I'm in med school!
##
Is that gas line run to the tank or would you run it to a second fuel cell 
with say racing fuel with a higher octanefor instance?
##
so, why not simply use cryo LOx?, pure oxygen injected would yield an 
enormous ammount of boost without leaving 2 free N atoms that will form 
extra NO contamination for the cat converter, plus it boils at -190C so 
even more cooler and more charge
##
awesome video, how much do those kits cost and how many times can you use 
it before you blow your gasket, head or the block?
##
I didn't really discuss pros and cons, you're right. Benefits include more 
power for a cheap price. Of course, if your engine can't handle the 
additional pressure/stress, you'll need better internals (goes for any 
modification). The danger with nitrous oxide comes from improper air/fuel 
ratios, which can damage the engine. If the air/fuel mixtures are kept at 
ideal levels, there's no reason why it can't be reliable. That said, it's 
better for short bursts of power, rather than long track days. 
##
Wheel spin, as in losing traction? 
##
It's when there's detonation that occurs not only from the spark, but 
elsewhere in the cylinder. Not a desirable thing to have happen. 
##
you should make a video of haw to spray safely, and haw to avoid damage on 
engines when sprayng.. 
##
Thx - keep up the good vids man!
##
That's a quote from the late Carroll Shelby.
##
Why did you have a kit for a Ford engine if you drive a Acura? Just 
wondering.
##
Is the fuel pressure regulator before or aftere the T going to nos spacer
##
What if you don't put the brass jets into the fuel line?
##
Doesn't nitrous fuck up the engine? 
##
Subed, now i wont think I'm a complete ass hat when people are talking 
about cars in school
##
Dude, can any car get 200 hp gain with that big nozzle or whatever??
##
omg yes it did. Thank You!! lol. But I always thought that Nitrous 
backfires had to do with leaky valves. Is that all hearsay? 
##
I have a question, wich i would be glad if you could answer: this is all 
fun and games, but you didn't talk about any downsides as you did in almost 
every video. I heard about extreme engine wear when using nitrous system. 
How much of this is true?(not to mention the price of nitrogen, and how 
long does a tank of it last)
##
Yes.
##
Also WOT switches like he mentioned only open at wide open throttle so you 
have optimal fuel/air/nitrous flow and nothing is restricted. Fuel pressure 
switches monitor your pressure so if the fuel pump or solenoid fail for w/e 
reason, nitrous is killed before you lean out and blow up. You can read 
your AFR off of a wideband o2 sensor as well to make sure you dont lean 
out. The only cons are engine wear in huge shots, and careless 
applications. Otherwise it can be done appropriately!
##
Great video! Got a full overview of how nitrous and the system works, 
Thanks ! :)
##
thats what i was thinking of too
##
Would this work on a Mitsubishi eclipse gts 3.0 ?
##
If the air/fuel mixture is too rich then perhaps, or if the burn duration 
is extended then maybe. But Hollywood makes things look way better :)
##
I have a video on carbs. Also, you don't need to request information in 
more than one comment - I read them all. 
##
Great videos. All are very detailed and in depth. You are a great 
engineer!!!
##
Hey what's a drive shaft?
##
So obviously we know the positives of the Nitrous system but are there any 
negatives to the system?
##
Just wanted to say thanks for all the straight to the point videos, 
everyone on youtube should take note that this is how you provide 
information to the masses. So much of youtube, especially about automotives 
is filler and nothing to do with anything.
##
You'll blow the welds on your intake.
##
You don't like research? XD
##
Could be!
##
You deserve more views! Thanks man!
##
Yep.
##
Do one about wheel hop! 
##
Amazing videos man keep it up! :) 
##
Keep in mind, the catalytic converter reduces HydroCarbon (gasoline) 
exhaust emissions. it is most likely to occur on a car that has no 
cat-converter, an engine in the back of the car, an early exhaust valve 
opening (after combustion), low compression ratios, and short exhaust 
pipes. I have modified some old car with carburetors, and flames can fire 
out the rear if you do it correctly.
##
I have a whole playlist on forced induction, look for it on my channel 
page! :)
##
First, Thanks for your great efforts getting these videos up with a lot of 
easy understood info!! I have one question, what are the "side effects" of 
nitrous on your system? thanks
##
Nitrous comes out of the nozzle at approximately -127deg F(as mentioned in 
the above video) when running for a short period of time you can use the 
nitrous to chill the air charge. Nitrous and Water/Methanol systems are a 
very popular combo on turbo drag cars
##
Well I'd say one big disadvantage is it isn't really a permanent power 
increase, so if you're going on track days you won't be able to sustain the 
increase in power, without swapping bottles. It's probably best for drag 
strips where the car is only running WOT for a fraction of a minute. 
##
wow, great channel! subscribed.
##
or automotive mechanics depending where you're from or what's available
##
Did you intend to post this on my new Corvette video?
##
Did you get to keep the nitro kit or did you have to send it back 
afterwards? And if you get to keep it are you going to put it onto your 
car??
##
Do you have to do anything special to the engine i have a 3800 series 2, 
3.8L what do you think? Ive heard i have to get forged pistons
##
You should do some videos about diesel engines. Not jettas. More like my 
f250. I'm pushing 1200 ft/lbs of torque. You know what they say horsepower 
sells cars torque wins races
##
You deserve far more video views than you get mate, keep up the good work! 
:)
##
oh i thought you were referring to 200 shot of nitrous on a a stock engine, 
being as it is a video about nitrous
##
You want a nozzle that atomizes well at the HP level you are jetting the 
system at for your application.
##
200 + HP here I come
##
I really want to get a nissan pulsar gti-r
##
Good points, especially about not having a closed loop at WOT. 
##
Um I just commented and once I reread my comment I noticed it made no sense 
my bad just ignore it lol.
##
Hey, i really enjoy the way you explain so if you can explain the oil feed 
line to a turbo charge it will be awesome That's my first thanx coz im sure 
that you will do it :)
##
I'd love to see a video explaining Drag Coefficients in detail.
##
Awesome video as usual!
##
I do. Sorry if I came off like a dick haha but still what you said is way 
off. It can be done very safely if you have the time and patience to learn 
before you do anything. Safeties include window switches (recall how torque 
is always higher than hp until 5250rpm) so this switch keeps nitrous off 
until around 3300 rpm, or whatever you set it too. It also cuts nitrous a 
few hundred rpm before your set shift points so you dont spray nitrous 
while off the throttle and blow the engine. next post:
##
you should explain this with a rotary engine diagram. Blow some minds!
##
Made sense, no worries!
##
Thank you for this video! Really informative, but how much would such a wet 
system cost?
##
Just to be sure. When you trigger the nitrous system, does it empty the 
whole bottle or do you control the duration of the shot?
##
youre videos are great man i learn so much information from you its 
awesome, dont stop making the vids!
##
Have a video about Forced Induction?? 
##
Too lean would cause overheat, yes. The jets (nozzles) control flow rate, 
yes. As for your final questions, depending on how much extra power you put 
in, you'll need to upgrade internal components. 
##
Hi there. Really great videos. On an unrelated topic I'd like to ask. Is 
Oxygen flamable at any state. the reason I ask is because I heard that they 
use Liquid O2 in rocketships as fuel. don't remember where I heard this and 
don't know if it's correct. When I went on a fire drill coarse they say 
Oxygen is NOT flamable. If oxygen is flamable at a curtain state, can you 
explain a bit. Thanks for your time
##
$400+ 
##
I'll also add that I wouldn't use it on a track car, only drags. Too much 
on/off throttle in the track to increase the chance of spraying for a 
moment while you let off throttle. Drag is straight forward.
##
you've got some great vids man, very well explained stuff. Coud you perhaps 
do a vid on water-methanol injection too? cheers
##
just dont blow the welds on your intake kid lol
##
A sudden addition of 200hp seems like I could harm the engine?
##
Wow thanks i just put some nitrous on my fiat 500 and it goes well!! :D
##
Could you do a video explaining oil weight? (I.e. 5w-30, 0w-20, 70w-90 and 
so on)
##
Awsm that i found your vids!
##
Truly appreciate the recognition, I try my best to keep things clear and 
concise. I agree completely, so many videos I watch just say "and this 
means the right tire gets more grip" and go no further. Tell me why!! It's 
frustrating, and I think it's part of the reason my channel has been 
growing so well. Thanks for watching!
##
Added weight, if your engine isn't built to handle the added pressure/temp 
of course it could fail. 
##
does the engine have to be modified?
##
For your viewing pleasure, Michael. 
##
Mechanical engineering.
##
He's just referring to the joint program between Subaru and Toyota. Scion 
FRS/Toyota BRZ.
##
Because nitrogen boils at -127 F. In the tank, it is compressed, keeping it 
a liquid. When it is exposed to the outside air, it instantly boils, 
dropping its temperature to -127 F. Changes in state means a big energy 
difference. Don't know if you've ever played paintball, you'll experience 
the same thing. As you shoot the paintball gun, it gets cold near the top 
of the CO2 tank; this is the liquid CO2 changing state and losing energy. 
##
Great video. Do you think you can create a video on diesel engines and how 
they differ from petrol engines?
##
Stops injecting while you're not on the throttle.
##
ive been going through heaps of your videos for the past hour or so. very 
informative and interesting stuff. i also kinda enjoyed watching you change 
from shy and withheld to open and welcoming as your videos progressed. 
great work, keep it up and definitely subscribed. 
##
Add it to you car. 
##
do you have to tune your car with the kit or since it is a wet shot it 
tunes itself? Well not really tune itself but run at a correct mixture
##
It's used to make sure the nitrous line is filled with nitrous, and ready 
to be injected (no bubbles, etc). It simply purges out some nitrous, 
ensuring the line is full. 
##
A knock on/to what?
##
What About the Direct Port Nitrous Injection????
##
Nah, I'm not looking to build it. We "can't" do it in Europe, tough laws on 
the matter. I still have to pass inspection. I was just wondering. I don't 
race. But if I had 10k under the hood I wouldn't need Nitrous ;) 
##
Great to hear!
##
If you had individual throttle bodies installed on your car would you then 
have to install multiple plates for the nitrous system.
##
Explain the HHO generator to the people :) 
##
This is also very wrong, if you've never used nitrous you shouldn't post 
false info about it. It does not smell any different, test pipes or a 
downpipe/cat delete will give you a gassy smell. Not nitrous. And its also 
not called "NOS". That is a brand. It's like asking your mother to pass you 
the "Uncle Bens" instead of rice. It also doesn't ruin your engine at all 
if done properly but you've clearly never done the research. Maybe you 
should actually watch this video. Or learn how it works.
##
well i understood the whole concept of nitrous working principle thanks for 
the video, will it effect on my engines performance in the future if i stop 
using nitrous.
##
thank you sir
##
where can I get nitrous oxide? I'm having a party :)
##
I like this video so much , well explained , thanks 
##
Why does it only boost at full throttle? Can you set it to inject nitrous 
at half throttle for example?
##
These videos are more informative than the classes at my engineering college
##
Thats awesome, you rock!! when the car is doing it's nitrus thing does 
purple stuff come out of the exhaust like in video games or Hollywood and 
does it makea really cool hissing sounds or is that just for effect? How 
long would the bottle last for?
##
Awesome explanation. Cheers!
##
I'm interested in Nitrous backfires, why they happen and how they can be 
prevented. Also water/meth vs nitrous seeing as nitrous does something 
similar to water/meth in it's application it makes me wonder how much could 
be had replacing the water/meth with nitrous and then matching something 
along the lines of a cfi or tbi for a good ratio. 
##
No awesome purple flames, unfortunately. I believe NX recommends not using 
nitrous longer than periods of 10 seconds or less. Maybe a bit more. It's 
not something you'd constantly run, as you'd run out fairly quickly. Great 
for drag races, not so hot for endurance track days. 
##
Bottles are refillable usually costs around $45 to refill. Nitrous systems 
start much cheaper ($399 for a basic system) than turbo/supercharger 
setups. If you do decide to go forced induction later on, nitrous will 
still work just as good when used in conjunction with the other power 
adders, and N2o will reduce air intake temps and help control detonation. 
##
Very informative video! I liked it!
##
yes, as long as a diesel has enough fuel to burn the nitrous it will work 
great! no engine parts will have to be changed. As a general rule of thumb, 
if it smokes it has enough fuel to add some nitrous.
##
Well, I suppose in the F&F movies, when they press it, they're already at 
WOT, so it could actually be accurate. If it's already at WOT, all it would 
need is for the on switch to be flicked to activate it. 
##
You can, but I personally wouldn't. A diesel naturally runs at a higher 
compression, meaning it has a higher acceleration rate anyway. That is why 
when you romp on it in a diesel it throws you back and just takes off. 
Personally, nitrous on a diesel would be pointless, just get a performance 
turbocharger.
##
Theoretically you could use it on anything, but you may have to build up 
the engine for the added stresses. 
##
good video 
##
Yes it is! It's used in anesthesia, mixed with oxygen. But it's also called 
the laughing gas when inhaled pure... a well-known side effect among med 
school students ;)
##
Hey in fast and furious 4 when Dom opens the valve of the nitrous bottle 
for the car to explode, since the nitrous is in a gas form it is a dry shot 
right? ps. make a video showing your car :)
##
Thanks!
##
should the entire cooling system upgraded when installing nos..e.g oil 
cooler intercooler..etc tq﻿
##
Or you can just inhale it.﻿
##
Dude amazing videos! All the indepth, nerdy car questions I had - explained 
in simple videos. 

cheers﻿
