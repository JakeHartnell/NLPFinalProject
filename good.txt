I love you Justin <3 you touched me in concert 8/3/13 :) love you're sweet 
voice :) #alwayskidrauhl #stillkidrauhl I have been a belieber since 2009 
and I am not going anywhere! <3 stay strong Justin haters don't know that 
you actually can sing and that you love you're fans <3 you are so depressed 
but you put on a fake smile everyday because we want you to be happy. You 
taught yourself the drums, guitar, piano and trumpet all before u turned 11 
<3 that's very very talented. <3 :)﻿

Guys, just stop hating. I am not a fan of Justin Bieber, but I just hate 
the hating comments. Just stop. He's probably more successful than all of 
you.﻿

People are so stupid these days.. like you are seriously going to believe 
everything you read on the Internet. Really? Like people need to realize 
that not everything is true that you read. So stop using every rumor to 
bash an amazing person who did nothing to you.
##
If you hate him so much, why do you come back after years? Just to hate on 
him? He must be doing something right.

Leave the kid alone. What great time you have to insult a person for no 
reason. Grow some maturity. Even if you dislake his talent, what did he do 
to you as a person? NOTHING. You negative people are the ones that make 
life a living hell for innocent people. Such filthy heart to hate a kid-15 
or 16 aat the time-. have courage and love and comment good things, or 
nothing what so ever. Only animals are known for savagness, so stop with 
the savagery comments. And apperently he loves his fans, enough to not give 
a bloody second thought of any of you who hate him for no atom weight of 
cause. Good luck writting filthy comments you're whole life while he 
becomes better at the things he does.

I LOOOVE HIM <3 <3﻿
