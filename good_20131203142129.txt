Thank you for the knowledge﻿
##
Could you please explain spool valve dampers? They are used in F1 and on 
the Aston Martin 177 and the upcoming Z28. Awesome Explanation BTW!
##
to keep the car from body roll even european cars since 1975 have anti roll 
bars connecting the 2 triangles, the stiffness of the anti rollbar decides 
how much the car goingto body roll
##
It reduces roll by transferring the force to the other tire, thus leveling 
the vehicle somewhat. The heave spring is for when both tires are lifted 
(hitting a bump, braking hard, etc.) it offers resistance to this motion. 
##
Your last sentence just shows that you do not understand simple forces. The 
fact that it is mounted horizontally as apposed to vertically means gravity 
is not acting against the motion of the damper. Not only will you find 
other sources that state a pushrod has less unsprung mass but if you know 
basic statics and mechanics you'll be able to show that with a simplified 
free body diagram.
##
Sorry that's incorrect your pushrod moves, your rocker moves and the shaft 
of the damper moves, so its the same as a conventional system but with the 
additional components (pushrod & rockers) moving also. The fact that the 
damper is mounted horizontally has nothing to do with removing unsprung 
mass.
##
Let's compare a conventional double wishbone and a basic pushrod double 
wishbone. The conventional set up has the damper moving up and down when 
the wheel goes over bumps. A pushrod set up has everything the conventional 
set up has with the addition of a pushrod, except that the coilover is now 
mounted horizontally and attached in such a way that only the weight of the 
pushrod (which is lighter than a damper) is moving up and down with the 
wheel. You understand?
##
It simply has to be strong enough, a 4 g load is probably no where near the 
bar's yield strength (where it would permanently bend). 
##
Correct, but the anti-roll bar acts to do the opposite, and tries to "lift" 
the left side thus keeping the car flat. 
##
man i was wondering the same thing. it seems the roll bar would snap if 
enough force was applied while cornering
##
I won't say all but yes it's a very common suspension set up. 
##
Do all formula 1 cars have double wishbone suspension front and rear? Also, 
is this suspension used in formula sheane?
##
@Engineering Explained can you explain the differences in handling & 
performance between an Fr and an Mr layout? 
##
Basically convention is that the chassis is sprung mass, and the wheel is 
unsprung mass, which is kind of simple to understand. The problem with the 
suspension is that it connects the two together so what is it, sprung or 
unsprung? The convention is to say that half the mass of the entire 
suspension system is sprung mass, half is unsprung mass. Their position 
doesn't matter to the unsprung/sprung, only the total mass, so more 
components are likely to have more mass, therefore more unsprung mass
##
How is the unsprung mass increased? There are more components involved, 
yes, but many of them (especially the heavy shock absorber) is moved 
inboard onto the chassis. What you're left with are simply the control arms 
and struts (some of which would be present regardless of the suspension 
layout). Are you saying the combined mass of a few extra members is MORE 
than a conventional double wishbone setup with a shock absorber and spring 
in terms of the unsprung mass? How so?
##
Indy and NASCAR are effectively a "spec" racing series. Formula 1 is 
nothing of the sort. Are there more similarities between the cars of today 
than the cars of the 70's? Sure. However, cost is a big reason to reign in 
the ability for teams to do any and everything they want. With the way 
things were headed, we'd have a 5-10 car grid filled with richest of teams 
as everyone else would have been priced out. 
##
Good video. 
##
Formula one is a race circuit like Indy or Nascar. What used to make it 
great and different was F1 was a manufactures race, which is to say, you 
were allowed to do pretty much anything you wanted to make the car go 
around the track faster. They are however changing that to be more like 
Indy or Nascar which are more a drivers race, which is to say, all the cars 
are pretty much the same.
##
oh ok,thats the reaction force..
##
The rocker arm is likely splined with the torsional bar inserted.
##
i am just wondering that how torsional bar is attached to rocker arm? are 
they welded together or what?
##
formula 1?
##
It would in the sketch in this video. But that's not how they are actually 
laid out in an F1 car. But if you get the spring stiffnesses wrong you can 
get the car to roll over the heave spring. So in a word you are correct, 
but, in reality they can engineer it so that it doesn't.
##
Now that you've mentioned it I do see your point on Unsprung Mass. I guess 
it really is primarily for reduced frontal area and lower COG than 
conventional setups.
##
Actually you have more components in a pushrod suspension and as the 
unsprung mass is considered to by half the mass of the moving components it 
is worse for unsprung mass, but, the packaging to move the component out of 
the air flow is the big benefit in terms of reduced drag and more efficient 
downforce from the front wing. Pullrods are theoretically better as they 
have a lower centre of gravity.
##
I thought the main advantage of a push rod suspension is to have less 
undamped mass and have all the mass in the center of the car where it gives 
a better center of gravity.
##
Conventional suspension still suffers from unsprung weight and aerodynamic 
disadvantages. Also, this is not reactive ride height. The car still has a 
fixed height which can not be altered without a pit stop. This system 
simply gives you greater bound/rebout spring tension range than a 
traditional setup can provide. But you still stuck with one setting when 
you're on the track. So you still have a car tuned for a section of track 
not the whole thing.
##
Not if the spring doesn't have a fixed point. Picture a sliding spring pack 
free to move left to right as the car leans, but which would compress when 
the car bumps or builds downforce.
##
He doesn't mention it, but these designs have other advantages. It is 
compact, meaning you can have a very low hood line. So even closed wheel 
designs will have aerodynamic benefits since they don't need as much body 
over the wheels. But mostly, it is because it reduces "unsprung weight" The 
more unsprung weight, the harder it is to keep the wheel in good contact 
with the road over any bumps. Unsprung weight reduction is why modern 
motorbikes use inverted forks.
##
i don't understand if it's for area dynamic.. why some supercar like the 
zonda uses them? it's not like the double A is expose to air flow
##
The design of the suspension is also beneficial to keep a lower center of 
gravity as well as allow for a lower profile design of the body of the car.
##
Seems to me that the heave spring and anti-roll bar do the completely 
opposite thing. So why are both of them needed?
##
Best of luck!
##
haha, thank you sir!
##
How is the rocker connected the torsion bar? 
##
is it possible for a push rod suspenion system without anti-roll bar and 
heave spring? some kind of independent push-rod suspention? i'm curious 
about the Ariel Atom front suspension... nice vid by the way... 
##
Well, I would assume there is some flexibility in the system, like in 
everyday systems. I do believe it is pretty stiff though. 
##
As far as the engine and transmission goes, I wouldn't want to change 
anything really. I would just want to upgrade the suspension system and 
brakes. The brakes would just be upgraded to vented wheel disc ABS with 3 
or 4 piston calipers. I'd also mount a low profile rear spoiler that would 
be shaped to cosmetically match the new body work and styling. Again with 
the "it's there but not overtly noticeable" approach. The body work itself 
would be done using fiberglass (yes I know it's cheap).
##
Thanks for pointing this out, and subscribing!
##
Titanium seems like a good choice, if that is in fact what most are made 
of. Not sure about the springs or calculations, but I suppose that's all 
going to be part of your research. Keep me updated on what you learn! 
##
having the components inboard also reduces unsprung mass
##
Can you please do a video of the Triplex suspension inside the Koenigsegg 
Agera? :)
##
Well explained ... you know your stuff, good going pal, interesting... 
##
I want to be a mechanical engineer when I am old enough and your channel 
will help me a lot thanks
##
I heard he was in his 20's. It's all hearsay though. 
##
I was just watching that episode 
##
Wheel does not change the angle when goes up and down so.. there is max 
traction in any case 
##
Thanks for watching!
##
Perfect
##
It is also in the new Lamborghini Aventador
##
lamborghini aventador :) 
##
Err there are no such things as "Honda-McLaren joint project", It was 
simply a Mclaren with a Honda engine and transmission. Just like how cars 
are named today - Mclaren-Mercedes, Lotus-Renault etc. And no Senna was 
never kicked out,he moved from Mclaren to Williams in 94 cause Prost kept 
kicking his butt in a much more technically advanced Williams car which had 
self leveling suspension (93) (which was later banned in 94), Senna moved 
cause he knew Mclaren couldnt keep up with the Williams car
##
engine porting video
##
This post probably would have been best as a PM. Best of luck with your 
project!
##
Thanks!!
##
Dude where do you work? Cause honestly you should be designing some sick 
cars with all your knowledge, honestly dude go work somewhere great.... 
Haha just wishing you the best of luck man!
##
I have never liked a video on YouTube before this one. Keep at it you're a 
credit to YouTube
##
Great group of videos, thanks!!!
##
Another consideration is that by bringing many components inboard one 
reduces unsprung weight so adding to the stability of the sprung mass. 
##
I actually found out what you meant shortly afterwards, but thanks after 
all :)
##
what about anti-ackermann steering geometry formula 1 uses?
##
here's a really good picture of everything 
doubleu,doubleu,doubleu.f1fanatic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/1-suspension-470x326.gif
##
tell me about it. youtube is great but this is one of the things that get's 
really frustrating. haha I guess I just have to learn to live with it
##
Not really true. There are people who like all forms of racing.
##
Great video man.. subscribed.....Do you know where i can find detailed 
information on designing the heave spring..and how it interacts with other 
two springs? thanx
##
I wonder if it is to counteract down force? To keep down force from 
compressing the suspension into the ground.
##
not to mention added traction because of more weight on the tires. This 
might be too obvious
##
and sorry about that one :) but what exactly is that ''underbelly plank"?
##
MacPherson strut, double-wishbone, pushrod and pullrod are all independent 
suspensions. I have videos on each.
##
I think another HUGE advantage you missed of pushrod suspension is all of 
the force from the road is concentrated to the center of the car, whereas 
on other suspensions, i think it's spread out to the outside. Do you agree 
with this being an advantage?
##
And Toleman
##
the antiroll bar has play in it like in street cars, how much it flexes is 
based on design, materials, and build quality. and as he says this is just 
one way to do anti roll and is used in f1 for its stiffness.
##
I love these videos. Thanks for posting. Subscribed! :D 
##
There's not enough suspension movement to need the camber gain of unequal 
wishbones. 
##
Then I want to mount a dual front splitter assembly (Basically two front 
wings an upper and lower wing. The Body work of the car itself won't be 
changed as this will all be internally done. The front end of the car will 
look somewhat different with two large openings on either side of the nose 
tip with the front lip of the car sculpted to allow smoother airflow into 
the air channels leading underneath the car. Functionally there but 
cosmetically hidden.
##
Great vid, quick question though, this setup wouldn't be very useful on a 
regular car, because it won't negatively affect aero efficiency since its 
all the same anyway right? by regular car i mean anything thats not an open 
wheel car (not the atom more like the integra haha)
##
I was one of those annoying folks that requested for this video some time 
back :) soooo... another question... if i understood it correctly, the 
benefits of this type of suspension largely points to racing i.e. not 
really practical/useful for normal road cars? which is why i only read 
about this kind of suspension on track day type cars?
##
Great video! I would just like to add that one of the other main reasons 
for push rod suspension is the unsprung mass. Since the majority of the 
suspension mechanisms are in the body, this greatly reduces the unsprung 
mass which increases the vehicle's ability to dissipate vibrations while 
keeping the setup extremely stiff as well as allowing the tires to keep 
contact with the road better. 
##
good explanation and good diagrams too - exactly how I would do it. very 
insightful and worth favouriting!
##
I want to get my hands on a stripped clean chassis of a Pontiac Fiero 
1987-88 model, cut the wheel wells out, gut out the forward subframe 
assembly (basically just clear out the entire front end) install larger 
diameter wheel wells. Reshape the frontend with large airflow channels that 
direct airflow through the front wheel wells which will be vented front and 
back and then custom engineer a pushrod style suspension system where the 
front trunk was.
##
Hadn't heard of it to be honest. Just checked out a video on it. Makes 
sense, having to alter the suspension due to high downforce from higher 
speeds, and prevent wear on the underbelly plank. Cool stuff!
##
this guy looks like Sergio perez 
##
Thanks for watching, and unfortunately no, I do not. Best of luck!
##
can i use video in my blog ? 
##
the one u can design better. 
##
Another amazing video!!!! I have 3 questions in mind though 1) Torsion bars 
are generally made of titanium due to lighweight. is there any alternative 
to it? 2) The heave spring used does it have some special qualities or 
would a regular coil spring help to do the job? 3) Calculations involved 
while assembling the suspension? Its all my research for SAE SUPRA 
INDIA2014 ( fabrication of an F1 car).
##
Right, I think it's an incredible design for the fact that it turns a 
vertical motion into a horizontal motion as opposed to other suspensions 
that simply let the car bounce up and down. I think this is one reason why 
you see the tires and suspension of F1 cars going up and down but the body 
of the car staying level. I'm not sure how to express my thought, but I 
hope I got it across clearly haha. It's hard to describe over text without 
being able to demonstrate with a drawing or something haha
##
Thank you!
##
Nice! Congratz!
##
This is great! You will appreciate your first car so much more by knowing 
how it works, rather than just taking advantage of what work has gone into 
it.
##
You're the way I learn this stuff ^^
##
So the whole idea is to design a system that works like an active 
suspension except with mechanical solution? Then why are the engineers 
still working on reactive ride height suspension, which I believe is the 
mechanical alternative for the illegal electronic version? Will a 
conventional suspension with a sway bar fitted produce the same effect? It 
seem to do a similar job with pushrod and way simpler. Anyway, what happens 
with the reactive ride height suspension? Hello... any F1 hardcore here?
##
Sure, as long as you say where it's from or have a link to my channel. :)
##
which is better? pushrod or pullrod?
##
can you do one on triplex suspension by koenigsseg
##
And with these kind of suspension you can afford to have a car with a 
larger base therefore more stable
##
Is the heave spring fixed to the body or does it just connect wheel to 
wheel? 
##
Lamborghini Aventador is the only real world application of a push-rod I 
can think of, unless you count the caparo t1.
##
What's playing on my mind is that, wouldn't the heave spring function as an 
anti-anti-roll bar (pro-roll bar)? 
##
You think Jeremy Clarkson watched this video after driving ktm x-bow?
##
Another reason for all inboard suspect
##
You didn't/forgot to mention that the pushrod suspension has a lower 
unsprung mass, which makes this mass oscillate less and thus gives the 
tyres a better controlled and more constant contact to a bumpy roadsurface 
(i.e. curbstones, etc..). But anyway great video, subscribed!
##
you should be working in a formula 1 team.....
##
Excellent video sir. Please, have my subscription :D
##
You don't need to correct yourself, there's no indication of whether the 
car is going toward or away from the camera. Great video btw, actually they 
all are, i love your method of delivery since these topics are usually 
difficult to convey through just wiki, where i usually go.
##
Yes
##
actually i have another account from 2009 but i made this this to be a 
clean new one in feb. also i'm from egypt....lol :P great to know u 
brother:))
##
Thanks! But you have not included in your Suspensions video list, so I 
couldn't find it out first. Also, you have a video on IRS vs Live Axle; 
while the video on Live Axle is titled Solid Axle, I couldn't find any 
video on Independent Suspension.
##
Interesting point, seems to make sense. I would then guess that the spring 
resistance is negligible (in comparison to the ARB) unless both tires were 
to be forced upward, where it would try to keep them planted. I do get what 
you're saying though. 
##
What an honor!! That's great to hear. Really makes me proud, and keeps me 
going my friend. Cheers!
##
The Aventador uses pushrod suspension :)
##
i too had the same question.....
##
You're welcome, thanks for subscribing!
##
Great video!! Subscribed!! Great to find videos explaing mechanical 
engineering!!
##
Hey nice video u teach better than my automobile engg sir..........btw can 
u plz create a video showing the steering system of f1 car???????? 
plzzzzzzzzzz
##
man, you gotta be the only American who understands how Formula 1 works :) 
##
Then for the rear wheels I'd basically do the same things as for the front 
end with the addition of two lower air ports on the sides of the car just 
rear of the door seams along the bottom edges of the doors while curving 
upwards by about 1-2 degrees. All of the changes to the car's original body 
work design would be subtle, mostly just a lot of smooting and rounding off 
corners, cleaning up the edges of the fenders and giving the car a sleeker 
appearence.
##
Errr Senna never drove for Ferrari, he only drove for Lotus, Mclaren and 
Williams 
##
Can you please tell us the mechanism of Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System 
##
Awsome video as usual!! Keep up the good work!
##
Hey, isn't that Ayrton Senna's F1 car there at the end?
##
Yaw moment of inertia is a good point, A bigger reason is the Lower 
Unsprung weight really helps in improved suspension dynamics.
##
Yeah I understand what you're saying. 
##
Fantastic video! Subscribed!
##
Can you do a video on the 2014 f1 engine and new kers for 2014 its called 
ers or somthing. That would be awesome.
##
Finally the interior would be redone with mostly modernization work in the 
form of newer gauges in the dash, new sound system, sat nav, custom sporty 
seats with uprated seat belts, and new steering wheel with built in airbag 
and an airbag installed for the passenger side as well. Most folks who 
modify a Fiero want to turn it into a fake Ferrari or something silly like 
that. I'd rather just upgrade the hell out of suspension, steering, and 
brakes. What do you think. Sorry about multi-posting. :)
##
Haha, may not be the correct terminology. Basically it's just a piece of 
wood (or some composite wood material) that is on the very bottom of the 
car. If it's worn more than a certain amount (meaning the car was scraping 
the ground) at the end of the race, the driver is disqualified. 
##
Me too.
##
NICE......
##
How would you describe pushrod suspension bein used in the supercars where 
there is space to use a normal suspension as well? LOWERING THE CENTRE OF 
GRAVITY AND ELIMINATING UNSPRUNG WHEEL MASS. 
##
instant subscribe 
##
this is the best explain that i ever see, congratulations 
##
Hey great video! I was just wondering if anyone here has any idea of what 
the Spring Stiffness and the Damping Coefficient for the Spring-Damper 
System are, as I am trying to work out the stresses in the push rod. Cheers
##
Haven't made it the whole way through this video yet, but wanted to thank 
you for posting it, as I wanted to learn the differences b/w push and pull 
rod designs in F1. Cheers.
##
Good vid mate. I can't help but hear ross from friends when your talking 
haha!
##
Maybe you could do a video explaining how a rising rate pull or push rod 
suspension works. Details about how the mechanical linkages cause the 
suspension to be progressive. 
##
F4 Car.. 
##
Hi, man! What do you think about the new so called FRIC suspension in F1 
(used and developed mostly by the teams of Mercedes AMG and Lotus). I 
regard it as quite intersting. 
##
Check out my videos MacPherson Strut and Double Wishbone. Both of these can 
be an IRS. 
##
Directly. I suppose there are various ways it could be done. Welded, 
splined, cast as a single piece. 
##
I understand youtube's reasoning for not allowing website posts, but 
sometimes it does get rather frustrating haha
##
brilliant, thanks man
##
That's my uncle.
##
I'm a big formule-one fan, I never understood what the difference was 
between pull and pushrod suspension so I'll have to thank you.... great 
video
##
You're welcome!
##
The Traxxas Revo chassis is a very popular pushrod/rocker type suspension 
for R/C trucks. It's been in use with many of the newer R/C trucks of the 
past decade to keep the suspension components down low for best center of 
gravity as well as allowing for insane axle vertical travel geometry and 
compactness, compared to traditional double a-arm vertical and shock setup.
##
Great explanation, mate. Isn't another *key* reason a push-rod suspension 
or pull-rod suspension is preferred in Formula 1 (and other types of racing 
or high performance cars) is that it reduces un-sprung weight?
##
@GrayFox1207 yes it is the new McLaren MP4-12C does this. It replaces the 
anti roll bar with a computer making the wheels truly independent from each 
other
##
can do you a Video about 'Snatched' Powerful 'Muscular' Start of the cars ? 
if you don't understand what I mean, search "skoda octavia acceleration" (a 
car owned by Volkswagen, with TDI Volkswagen / Audi Diesel Turbo Engine) 
this is the car with The Best "Snatch" Start I've saw (including it's 
Equivalent : Volkswagen Bora [plus Passat Models]), probably French Cars 
also have "Snatch" Start : who build also Very Nice Diesel Engines Better 
Cars DON'T HAVE THE SAME SNATCH START ! :-O I wonder Why
##
Thanks good luck to you as well
##
Reference away, that's quite a compliment! Glad to hear that they can help 
you! I took an automotive engineering course in college. Being that I had 
this channel, I figured I should do well - I made the highest grade in the 
class haha. 
##
Why is that most f1 vehicles go with the parallel wishbone setup vs unequal 
length wishbone setups? Does aero play a big role in there decision?
##
I've never done a Private Message on Youtube before and I'm unfamiliar with 
how to send one. Sorry. By the way, do you think my idea of modifying a 
Fiero's suspension is plausible?
##
Nope, I think he went on about his blissful life without a second thought. 
##
how old is this guy?
##
Another benefit to the inboard board suspension is centralized mass. The 
weight of the car is more balanced between the 4 tires making the car more 
maneuverable and easier to handle.
##
If its a hard left hand turn the body will want to roll on its right not 
its left and the anti roll bar will stabalize the car in the corner keeping 
it flat trying to eliminate body roll in a corner , but good instructional 
vid 
##
NO
##
Pretty much. The downside of this suspension type is that the wheel travel 
(vertically) distance is very small, so real road conditions couldn't be 
accounted for. But on a track, that's smooth, it's a terrific set-up. 
##
Awesome video, however I have one concern.From the geometry you described 
the anti-roll bar is infinitely stiff. Every motion of one wheel directly 
and rigidly affects the other, losing the 'independance' of this suspension 
set up. Was this intentional? Normally, a sway bar provides some adjustable 
degree of roll stiffness.Great video series though!
##
Great explanation! Subscribed!
##
AWESOME STUFF. subscribed. Dude look at the camera. :)
##
Hmm... you seem to know a lot of F1 stuff for an American, which I believe 
prefer NASCAR and drag.
##
Having the weight more central is an advantage, yes. It reduces the cars 
moment of inertia in the plane parallel to the ground, meaning less 
resistance to rotating (or turning). 
##
Thanks for watching! Sometimes I just have to admire my own artwork, you 
know? Haha, my apologies. 
##
Apologies. Ayrton drove the Marlboro-sponsored Honda-McLaren joint project 
F1 car until he insulted it and lost his sponsorship, which ultimately 
killed him in the end. And ahh yes Nigel Mansell was quite the driver as 
well.
##
Thanks for subscribing!
##
is weight distrubution another key factor to push rod suspensions because 
the shocks, instead of being located at each wheel they are in the center 
of the car giving an equal weight distrubution and a lower center of 
gravity?
##
awsum !\ 
##
If I do recall, Jeremy got to drive the Aventador, while captain slow had 
the MP4-12C to handle, while the hamster had a go at the M600.
##
Hmm that's interesting. I can see what you're saying, but that would also 
kinda make it seem more like a solid axle where lift on one side affects 
the other as well. Though it probably is best to have the suspension as 
centralized as possible (and all weight, for that matter). 
##
you are awesome!!! petrol head+ mech. engineer+ top gear fan!!!!!! much 
love man!!!! :D
##
Fantastic explanation there mate! The parts looked so confusing when I 
watch the engineers on TV setting up the car during practice session of the 
F1 event. Then you simplified everything thank you so much. I'm starting a 
Motorsports Engineering course this September and your tutorials will 
benefit me to aim top grades, which I should anyway since I'm a car and 
race-car enthusiast. I hope you don't mind using your tutorials as a 
reference, I assume you take that as a compliment ahah
##
I made a jalisco jumper, aye!
##
Sorry hit wrong button. Lol. Another reason for all inboard suspension is 
for less unsprung weight. Just my two cents. Good vid. Keep it up
##
please do a video on independent rear suspension. I can't find anything on 
youtube 
##
I don't think he ever drove for Ferrari. Correct me if I'm wrong. I looked 
up Ferrari's drivers for 1989: Gerhard Berger and Nigel Mansell. 
##
Thanks!
##
Crystal clear explanation. Keep it up man! I plan on being a mechanical 
engineer myself.
##
The pushrod suspension assembly in the back is where I'd expect to run into 
serious difficulties in implementation. There might not be enough room in 
the rear end for such a system as I'm not sure if the original transmission 
in the Fiero is in front of the engine or behind it further towards the 
back of the car. If it's in the front of the engine than it's doable. If 
it's mounted in back of the engine with the rear differential also at the 
back it might prove tricky with the lack of space.
##
Haha thanks, I was surprised you were able to get the username captain 
slow, and it seems your account is fairly new - cool. 
##
if the car is cornering towards the right why does the left wheel get 
lifted up?!..mass is transferred to the left wheels,so the right wheels 
lift up...
##
YAY... you just took me 3 steps closer to building my Aventador replica.. 
Thanx..﻿
