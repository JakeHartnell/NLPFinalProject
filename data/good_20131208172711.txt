From a dissertation entitled "Unfit for Bondage: Disability and African American Slavery in the United States, 1800-1860" by Dea Hadley Boster of UMichigan, p. 96-99:

"Psychological and neurological conditions also affected the soundness of African American slaves. Although some antebellum observers -- using the misinterpreted results of the 1840 census as evidence --  argued that 'hard working' slaves were less susceptible to the disappointments of a more 'refined' life and thus less likely to be afflicted with nervous disorders than their white masters, there are many cases of bondspeople identified with a variety of psychological and neurological disorders. In 1953 historian William Dosite Postell examined antebellum probate records from different counties and parishes in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi and Louisiana, and determined that of the 31,170 slaves mentioned in these records, 391 were identified as suffering from some type of mental affliction; the records use such terms to describe them as simpletons, imbeciles, crazy, deranged, insane, 'subject to spasms' or fits, and afflicted with paralysis, palsy, and spinal injury. However, Postell acknowledges that slaveholders and overseers inconsistently applied these labels, and because of these irregularities, the prevalence of nervous disorders among African American slaves was probably much higher than his statistical analysis indicates. **Moreover, Todd Savitt has pointed out that a majority of individuals with mental disorders, white and black, were not institutionalized in the mid-nineteenth century, and these slaves were just incorporated into plantation life; indeed, 'the lines separating mental soundness from temporary and total insanity were necessarily hazy.'** However, any personality, emotional, or neurological disorder was viewed as important for disclosure in slave sales [...] The loss of labor, and difficulty in controlling slaves with nervous ailments, made mental and neurological disorders a significant cause of unsoundness in African American slaves."

Basically, if they were functional enough to be of any use to the plantation, they were given the tasks they could manage even if those tasks were somewhat small. They were likely treated somewhat like children on the plantation. If they were not useful at all or were a liability, they probably were disabled to the point where their lifespan would naturally be short, whether by illness, lack of the ability to take care of themselves, or accidental death.

EDIT: Looks like chapter 8 ("Insanity") of Todd Savitt's *Medicine and Slavery: The Diseases and Health Care of Blacks in Antebellum Virginia* (University of Illinois Press, 2002) may also be of interest to anyone who wants to know more about this.

Great find from an interesting dissertation! 
##
Really neat reading. Between you and /u/ProfessorRekal I have learned a lot about the question I asked. Interestingly I know in Brazil that mentally ill slaves were often just thrown out or killed, but up until now I had no idea how they were dealt with in the US. So thank you for your well informed answer.
##
Was there any incentive for slave owners to report their slaves as "defective" in some way? I know that slaves were taxed as a kind of "property", so if a slave was defective they might be worth more and the tax lower?


##
Not really. If you have a crappy car, you're stuck with a crappy car. You can maybe sell it to someone, but you'll probably take a financial hit. Slaves were bought and sold like cars. An unsound slave was a burden, and you either sold him or just tried to make as much use of him as possible until you could get rid of him.
##
Well, my question was really about reporting slaves as being "reported" as impaired when really they weren't. Southern tax dodging kind of thing.
##
What I think he means is there is no financial benefit to reporting it so there would be not motivation to falsify such a report.
##
Cool. I do a lot of genealogy and it is always fascinating and heartbreaking to see "values" assigned to slaves in tax documents along side cattle and grain stores. I wasn't sure if a standard value was always used or it was based on some kind of criteria. 
##
I  failed to consider the notion that most severely disabled people,  rich or poor, often died  young  back then.
However,  is it also possible that genetic disabilities in african american  gene  pools were also reduced during the  brutal trans atlantic  voyages?
##
Human evolution works much, much more slowly than that. Just taking out the less healthy members of one generation of a group is not enough to significantly reduce genetic disabilities. 
##
From caring for disabled adults, I know that one problem a carer has to constantly watch for in immobilised people is pressure sores, which can stem from something as simple as a crumb from dinner getting under a leg. Pressure sores get infected easily, and infections before the discovery of penicillin killed swiftly and easily. 
##
Also, weren't the elderly and disabled often just left for their families to take of them, sharing out their food from whatever they managed to grow for themselves on the little plots they were given to grow their own food? I mean, if they were too broken to sell, I imagine that slave owners just turned a blind eye to the issue, and let other people's charity provide for them?
##
Sometimes. But also sometimes the masters did take care of them. Not all masters were complete jerks. Some did actually consider their slaves part of their family in some way.
##
Thanks. Do you know if this often fell out on the side of the house staff v. field hands? It would seem that thinking of a cook or housekeeper, upstairs maid, or nanny (mammy?) as part of your family, would be more natural than thinking of the dozens of field hands that way? Or am I just too influenced by novels and tv?

Edit: I'm thinking of larger plantations here. I think that in a smaller household, it would be hard *not* to think of the people you see every day for years, as part of the family.

Edit2: I also realised I have no idea of the average number of slaves a large plantation would own. Probably more than 'dozens'. Hundreds?
##
It was actually rare for a plantation to have a large number of slaves. 88% of slave owners had fewer than 20 slaves, and 50% had less than 5. It was likely the master would be invested in all of his slaves, unless he was one of the few that owned a huge plantation.
##
Thanks, that certainly wasn't the picture of it I had.
##
This is an extremely good response. But I'll be the layman and ask you if disabled slaves weren't just murdered/euthanized? Wasn't that the norm for all humanity unless you were wealthy and humane enough to afford to keep disabled and handicapped individuals alive?
##
Honestly, I don't know much about the experience of physically or mentally challenged individuals enduring slavery, so frankly I'm as curious as you are. 

One related theme I can comment on is the treatment of elderly slaves, who might have suffered from similar ailments. The stereotypical image of elderly slaves presented in the antebellum South and later in various forms of popular media is that of paternalistic slave masters taking gentle care of slaves too old or infirm to continue working, ensuring their safety, security, and comfort as they slipped into their dotage. 

Undoubtedly such behavior occurred in some slave households. But it wasn't typical. More frequent was exploitation in another cruel form. Slave owners sometimes sold elderly slaves for cheap prices before the point of complete physical exhaustion. Providing food, clothing, care, and medicine for a slave cost money, which cut into often already very tight profit margins for many slave plantations. Better to sell then while some tiny profit can be still drawn from their bodies. Such slave sales broke up slave families and sundered decades of relationships. 

Most common was emancipation of elderly slaves. At first glance this would seem like a boon, not a burden. That would certainly be the case if the slave was freed in their youth or middle-age, when wealth, careers, and families might provide the basis for support in their final years. But emancipation at age 75 or 80 meant supporting yourself at the moment when you have no resources to do so. Elderly slaves often couldn't work because of bad health incurred by decades of literally back-breaking labor. There's no pensions for emancipated slaves, no subsidized housing, no social support net of any kind. The best an emancipated slave could expect were "freedom dues" given by their masters, which often consisted of cash, land, or the materials needed to farm independently. But awarding such freedom dues was the exception, not the rule in much of the South. Elderly freemen struggled to feed, clothe, and house themselves and often required charity and luck to survive for any extended period. 

The widespread practice of essentially abandoning elderly slaves  became a condemned practice across the South (and beyond). State legislatures tightened emancipation laws in the last decades before the Civil War to deal with this problem, which in turn restricted overall access to emancipation for both young and old. Some states, [like Missouri](http://books.google.com/books?id=EW1ox4CWx9YC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;dq=elderly+slaves+cost+emancipation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GPSMUsOeHMzrkAfO8IHgCw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=elderly%20slaves%20cost%20emancipation&amp;f=false), forced slave masters to post substantial bonds aside for every elderly slave they freed to discourage the practice. But the tossing aside of laborers after decades of exploitation remained a common practice until the end of slavery in the South. 
##
This is fascinating! It's straying further from the original question, but what was life like for a free black in the antebellum south? Were they mostly these elderly freed slaves? Do we have any data or good estimations for the size of the southern free black population?
##
I've read [Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidents_in_the_Life_of_a_Slave_Girl), written by Harriet Jacobs, and in the book she had a free grandmother. She had been bought by a kindly old lady who set her free and then she made money as a baker.

Like the poster above, Jacobs stressed how that wasn't always the case. She said old slaves were sometimes sold somewhere isolated where they died from abuse. But sometimes, as was the case with her grandmother, she was good enough at a craft (baking) to support herself.
##
*Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl* is one of the great slave narratives of the 19th century, and provides compelling examples like this. After *Twelve Years A Slave* I'm hoping Hollywood gives this narrative a look.
##
Wait, did they actually do a good job in terms of historical accuracy with 12 Years?
##
FYI: It's available as an audio download via librivox.org. (Listened to it on one of my more recent road trips)
##
Not a satisfying answer, but if you're interested in the topic, you might want to consider reading 'My Bondage and My Freedom.'

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Bondage_and_My_Freedom

I've never read it in its entirety, but what I've read has been interesting.



##
There was a slow move toward segregation, as black communities arose that largely emulated the white communities. Even today, you have in the South, and even other areas of the county, entire cities that are right next to each other. These cities have entirely separate city services despite their extreme proximity. Basically, one was the "white" city and one the "black" city. Gradually you had black banks, black schools, black churches, etc... 

Of course, one of the major injustices was that state support of public services in the South was notoriously lacking for just this reason. Because whites had always controlled most of the wealth in the region, private funding or local funding was the preferred means of financing services. By stifling state investment in these services, segregation served as a mechanism for limiting the power and influence of blacks. 
##
At work, so I can only give a very, very short message; however, you may also be interested in doing some quick research into the fascinating phenomenon of black slave owners.
##
The impression I got was one of "Out of sight, out of mind."

The act of emancipation was most likely a legal form of abandonment. 

"I release you from my service. Go and die in whatever way you see fit." 

Disclaimer: this is speculation based on what /u/ProfessorRekal said.
##
Free Blacks made up far to large a portion of Southern cities, especially the two largest Baltimore and New Orleans to be "out of sight, out of mind". 
##
There is a large amount of very good scholarship about antebellum free(d) blacks. The seminal work here i Ira Berlin's Slaves Without Masters. Written in 1974, he argued that whites "would not tolerate free Negroes living among them" (1). 

Recently, though, historiography has increasingly saw relationships between whites and blacks as less antagonistic. For example, Melvin Ely's Israel on the Appomattox (2004) discusses the settlement of Israel Hill, a freed black community in Virginia. Here, Ely argues against past works, like Berlin, that "assert[s] that the white South’s behavior towards free blacks before the Civil War constituted a kind of dress rehearsal" (446). Israel Hill illustrates the exact opposite. He contends that civil, even friendly relationships formed between whites and blacks. In this environment, blacks successfully sued whites for property losses. It should be noted, though, that Ely argues that Israel Hill's success was a direct result of its small population. That is, the population on Israel Hill so dwarfed the large slave population that many whites did not see them as a threat

EDIT: Also, many historians focus on different arenas where free blacks could gain a better degree of freedom. One of my favorite books here is Jeffrey Bolster's Black Jacks: African American Seamen in the Age of Sail (1997). It argues that, at least before the Civil War, the sea operated as a sort of meritocracy, where able blacks were able to achieve some degree of autonomy in the team-oriented task of sailing.

You could read [Thirty Years A Slave](http://www.forgottenbooks.org/books/Thirty_Years_a_Slave_1000378369) (from bondage to freedom), pretty sure it covers that.
##
Why were profit margins on plantations so thin? It seems like not having to pay wages would lead to a fairly profitable business.
##
Plantation or large-scale farming could be quite profitable and adaptable, but it also could be perilous if you were unlucky or a bad financial manager. In terms of finance, for most of the year plantation owners are spending money, not earning it. Harvest was the one big payday every year, and when the crop came in and the market set a high price then high profits could definitely be made. But if the harvest didn't pan out due to bad weather or a recalcitrant workforce (unhappy slaves were known to deliberately sabotage and slow down production) then your one big pay day is ruined. Greater unpredictably came from the price you'd get at market. As commodities tobacco, cotton, and other major crops experienced soaring and collapsing prices throughout the 19th century. Getting caught on the wrong side of a price fluctuation could wipe out a farmer fast. 

The above scenario applied to all farmers in the U.S. However, the risks were compounded in a slave economy. Slaves represented significant investments of capital that could vanish if a slave died, was injured, or escaped. Indeed, slaves and land were the main form of wealth slave owners possessed. Another significant risk impeding high profitability was the exorbitant lifestyles of many slave owners. High levels of conspicuous consumption was then, as now, markers of elite status that slave owners craved. Slave owners often struggled to manage high debts, and frequently resorted to selling land and slaves to settle their accounts.

But even when all went well, slaves still represented an enormous expense to their owners. While they weren't paid wages, the owner had to provide food, lodging, clothing, medical care, and a security system (overseers) to make sure their "property" didn't run off or kill them in the night. The largest plantations could be the size of small towns, requiring all the infrastructure a town requires, only at private expense. It was for this reason that planters like Thomas Jefferson constantly feared [financial disaster](http://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/debt). 

Now imagine if an employer was given a choice - choice #1 is paying a cash wage that is predictable from week to week, with the option of firing or laying off a worker if demand fell off. Choice #2 is paying a fluctuating and unpredictable price for everything a worker requires to be productive and compliant. That price is paid seven days a week, year after year, decade after decade. If work is slow your employer might be able to sell you to someone else, but could very well take a significant financial loss in the process. From an economic perspective I'm guessing the hypothetical employer will pick the paycheck every time. 
##
If that is true, then why did slavery persist?
##
It grew to become an "addiction" for the most elite of the Southern planters.  Their fortunes were tied specifically to their land and the cash crops it produced, sensitive to weather and commodity price changes, so there was often insufficient liquidity to "diversify".  

There was infrastructure and industry to invest in, but it was not on the scale seen in the now burgeoning Northern states.  The denser cities began taking on great numbers of immigrants, "free" labor that capital rich factory owners could hire and fire on a whim without worrying about the sociopolitical liabilities (at least until the end of the Gilded Age).

Now bear in mind, this system of large-scale slavery served the people at the top very well; Natchez, Mississippi was home to most of the wealthiest Americans before the Civil War.  It meant, however, that any fluctuation could drastically alter their fortunes - hence the willingness to block even the hint of abolition for decades before finally triggering secession.

Would someone live long enough to be emancipated?  A [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/29/news/life-expectancy-for-blacks-in-us-shows-sharp-drop.html) article from 1990 discusses the drastic change in life expectancy in the black community over the past 80 years.  According to this article, in 1910 nonwhites lived an average of 35.6 years.  

With minimal healthcare, work environment, diet, and etc. I would assume that the average slave probably lived a fairly short life.

Here is the link to the article.
http://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/29/news/life-expectancy-for-blacks-in-us-shows-sharp-drop.html

Edit: spelling
##
Remember, average life expectancy encompasses childhood mortality as well. Once someone made it into adulthood, their chances of a longer life beyond 36 years were much higher.

Besides, with slaves fed poorly and worked hard, it meant that their bodies broke down earlier, and the disabled would be in the same boat as the elderly.
##
&gt; Remember, average life expectancy encompasses childhood mortality as well. Once someone made it into adulthood, their chances of a longer life beyond 36 years were much higher.

That is precisely the fact people need to keep in mind when they read life expectancy figures.

If a child has a 30% chance of dying before he or she reaches the age of ten (both arbitrary figures chosen for this example), that has a significant impact on overall life expectancy figures.

So, a statistic derived from life expectancy of those who have made it through childhood would end up much higher and, I would suspect but have no sources handy, be not too dissimilar to the figures we see today.
##
Exactly. I see that especially when people are talking about the middle ages. While actual expectancies seem to differ a little bit, I've seen quite a few articles that show that if a person during that time lived to his teens (some studies say to age 18) then they'll have a life expectancy that may be as high as age 70 or even higher.

Basically, the main reason developed countries today seem to have significantly higher life expectancies isn't just that we allow people to live a lot longer, but also that we've seriously limited infant mortality.
##
I see it a lot when talking about the future.  Just because we've moved the average up so dramatically doesn't mean we're on the verge of living until we're 150.  Life extension is a field very much in its infancy and is probably one of the most difficult problems medicine has ever dealt with.
##
Furthermore, there was an elevated risk of mortality at every age, but not really a sharp increase until the late 60s or 70s. 

So it was certainly the case that you were significantly less likely, even as a 20 year-old, to live to 60. However, you were still quite likely to live to 40. Similarly, as a 40 year-old, you were quite likely to live to 60. The curve, so to speak, was shallower than today, but still generally ended at the same ages.
##
&gt; So, a statistic derived from life expectancy of those who have made it through childhood would end up much higher and, I would suspect but have no sources handy, be not too dissimilar to the figures we see today.

Are there any studies that have produced data on this topic? If they are out there, I would be very interested in reading them. I am an early modernist and, as you might imagine, I'm getting pretty sick of the assumption that most people died at 40 when the reality is much more complicated.
##
I found some curves for hunter-gatherers once, but I've since lost them.  They generally supported the basic principle (the papers also had curves for chimps, which were completely different--which was interesting.   They really do get old and die a couple decades sooner than humans)
##
Good point.  One would think that the mortality of slaves was pretty high from work related injuries and infections.  The best answer would probably come from the accounting books of plantations to see how the slaves were disposed of.

The things that come to mind are terrible enough; I cannot imagine what was actually done.
##
That's why you give the standard deviation when you give somebody a mean.
##
Wouldn't that simply redefine 'elderly' then? We see someone who is 70 or 80 as elderly, but I assume that in a society where people don't like past 40 that would be seen as old?
##
Not really, because a 40 year-old wasn't actually "elderly." Elderly is as much a term for a person experiencing the negative conditions of old age as it is a term for people who have lived a long time.

If you saw an 80 year-old who was in better shape than you, still running marathons by day and chopping wood by night, you probably wouldn't consider him elderly. (And those types of people do exist.) But if you saw a 60 year-old who was wrinkled and bald and could only get around with a walker, you would probably consider him to be elderly.

Furthermore, "elderly," as you've pointed out, is a relative term. Let's pretend, for the sake of simplification, that the top 10% oldest people in society are considered to be elderly. Considering that it's *infant* morality that's causing the skew in life expectancy, your population is going to be limited by that in every decile. Thus, you end up with the same result, just with lower numbers.

Basically, as a practical matter (and for certain statistical purposes) you wouldn't consider deceased infants as a part of your population when determining an age for "elderly" because they, as grim as it may sound, were never really a part of society.
##
As /u/NoNeedForAName says, it wasn't quite as drastic as the average mortality would suggest. However, people did tend to be more "worn down" in the past. Just as a modern working-class individual in a labor-intensive job is, on average, in significantly worse health at 60 compared to an upper-middle class individual in a white-collar position.

Your lawyers and doctors, even then, would likely view 50 or even 60 as a young age to die. However, hard laborers would typically have difficulty working past 50, and the number of 70-year old working-class or peasant elders would be very small. 
##
From what I've seen of old - world village communities, this really is not true at all.
##
Hmm, I've read studies that indicate a somewhat higher lifespan. Herbert Klein's book 'The Atlantic Slave Trade (New Approaches to the Americas)' seems to indicate that once out of the traditonally perilous infancy and youth period, life expectancy was higher than that.

Klein seems to indicate that the myth of survival on the plantations (the oft quoted 'dead within 7 years of arriving' stat from abolitionist literature) was related to a misunderstanding of the types of negative population growth experienced as a result of 'age and sexual imbalance' instead of as a result of high plantation mortality. He also indicates that these populations - and 'native born' slaves - experienced positive population growth.

While he estimates that a good 25% of slaves imported from Africa died within their first 18 months in the Americas, he also states that a newly arrived slave of around 20 years could expect at least 20 more years of life once arrived; 80% of those who had survived high child and infant mortality rates could expect to live into their mid forties and fifties.

[Some additional reading for citations](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_QiGQbD7m7EC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;lpg=PA178&amp;dq=life+expectancy;+slaves&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vnXEcjgIld&amp;sig=EqFYxlWUct0KT62SblkWHg0mkrc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SgCNUsriOc-thQfH9ICgDQ&amp;ved=0CGcQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=life%20expectancy%3B%20slaves&amp;f=false), if you're curious.

##
When looking at life expectancy of the past, you have to take into account high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from disease, child birth, epidemics etc. So the number doesn't mean that people were only living to be about 35, that once you made it past a certain point, you could live to be 60-70. I think for slaves, the threshold for being old was high, but some still made it. 
##
Distributions are more important than averages for figuring out what you should expect to see. People in disadvantageous living conditions often display a crossover mortality effect. This is well known in the African-American community of today (do a search on it and you will find abundant epidemiological research; a good paper is Elo and Preston, “Racial and ethinic differences in mortality at older ages,” in Racial and Ethnic Differences in the Health of Older Americans, L. G. Martin and B. J. Soldo, Eds., pp. 10–40, National Academies Press, Washington, D.C, USA, 2004.), and I would assume it was present back then. There is an extremely high mortality rate among the young that essentially produces an extremely robust older population, by eliminating most of the less fit population. An African-American at age 80 has a much greater life expectancy than a European-American at the same age, although there is a lesser chance of getting there. Even under horrendous living conditions, there should have been a sizable elderly population.
##
Thanks for that response, very interesting. 

I have a follow up question about the age you mention, would slaves (or people in general) really have a life expectancy close to 75 or 80 at during that time period in the South?
##
But who would buy a slave who is obviously old and is soon to be useless?
##
Slaves were used for other work than on plantations. A not-rich single-family household could always use a slave or two about the place for outside chores, or inside ones like a maid, cook, servant or laundress. Being not-rich, they wouldn't get the pick of the prime, but anyone with a few years left might prove a better investment than hiring the cook, the maid, etc.  And even if you didn't own a farm, you might have some horses to take care of, the carriage to keep in repair, firewood to be chopped, etc. As well, store owners and other businesses used slaves for all manners of work: chores, stocking, cleaning and errands.

Slaves performed every task that our current service industry does, it wasn't all grueling plantation labor.
##
I imagine people with low skill, labor intensive but not physically demanding repetitive tasks that need doing. Someone in this position could easily buy a slave for a few years profit, then emancipate them right before they became even too useless for this
##
&gt;I don't know if that is accurate, but that's what I'm imagining.

Please find a source for these kinds of statements.
##
Sources please?
##
There are an incredible number of direct interviews with slaves accessible through the internet.  There was an enormous project during the Depression to interview former slaves in the U.S.  There is an ENORMOUS amount of material that has many stories from various states in the U.S. directly from the words of slaves.

"Providing food, clothing, care, and medicine for a slave cost money"

Wasn't one of the pro-slavery argument that the slaves needed to be kept in bondage for their own good so that they would not have to compete and risk starvation ?
##
That's true. Pro-slavery arguments did articulate a belief that slaves were incapable of managing themselves as free people, and that slavery was thus a benevolent and necessary institution that provided both material prosperity and spiritual salvation in the form of Christianity. 
##
How did people manage to believe that when there were free blacks who did survive? 
##
What was the legal situation regarding murdering/'euthanizing' a slave; could an owner murder a slave?
##
In theory it was illegal to murder your slave, in practice it was extremely rare for a master to be convicted for murdering a slave even when the evidence is overwhelming. Partially this can be attributed to a long standing tradition that a master could do whatever he wanted with his property. 
##
Did the criminal code specify that it was illegal to murder slaves or were they just included in the definition of "human" for that purpose? Did that vary by jurisdiction? And what other crimes could be committed against slaves? (By that I mean what else was theoretically illegal to do to a slave, whether or not it could be enforced) Thanks for so many great responses!
##
Slaves were generally not considered persons, they couldn't testify in court for instance. This is partially why the South had so many kangaroo courts, often "proof" of a slave rebellion came from a slave informer but there was no legal remedy towards this information. In regards to other laws /u/lawdog would be better able to answer that question, but rape of slaves was legal in every southern state with the exception of Georgia. Generally speaking you could do whatever you wanted to your slaves without much fear of legal repercussions. As far as treatment goes the general rule is that the further South you go and the further west you go, slave treatment becomes worse and worse. Fear of being sold south is where the phrase "being sold downriver" emerges from.
##
Interesting! Thanks!
##
There was a law saying a master could not be punished if a slave died due to discipline,  because no one would willfully hurt their property. 
##
Why would a slave owner destroy their own property when they paid tens of thousands (in today's currency) for?
##
[Societies  \[even today\] exploit the labor of the mentally disabled](https://www.google.com/search?q=mentally+disabled+slave), providing simple tasks and limiting their movement.

Every agricultural society has tedious hand work.  Picking rope, sorting berries, or husking beans were activities that the infirm, the very old, or very young were expected to perform.  The worker sat on a stool or tree stump, reached into the bag on one side, picked or tore or plucked the item apart, and threw it into a bag on the other side.  

No one would be surprised to see that one of the workers had an iron band around his waist, and he was chained in place, and not given a knife.

##
That is true. I saw slavery/worker abuse a lot in Brazil, in the Sugar Cane plantations. It is very common for many of the workers to be enslaved or owe more than they can ever pay back to the farm owners.
##
&gt; That is true. I saw slavery/worker abuse a lot in Brazil, in the Sugar Cane plantations. It is very common for many of the workers to be enslaved or owe more than they can ever pay back to the farm owners.

What were you doing there, and did you do anything about it?
##
I was a teenager, and in many of those towns you cannot do anything about it. Sometimes everything they have belongs to the farm owners, so "freeing" them would only cripple/ruin them financially and socially. I wish I could do something, but at my age I couldn't change it. Add in police corruption on every level from local to federal it can be impossible depending on who owns the farm/farms/plantation.
##
Similarly, I saw that same situation in the Dominican Republic in the sugar cane plantations. Incredibly poor Haitians are told they will be given jobs and housing in the DR, but once they cross the border, their documents are burned and essentially they become stateless, forced to live and work in these plantations or risk getting arrested and deported back to Haiti, losing their families. Really tough stuff to see. But, like you said, there's not much you can do about it. The governments down there have no impetus to change it. 
##
It is common, except that in Brasil the Brazilians are being enslaved by other Brazilians.

Depends on how disabled. If they were 'weird' but could function, it might be a good thing. Just had a lecture yesterday about [Millie and Christine McKoy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millie_and_Christine_McKoy) conjoined twins who were born into slavery and became quite famous, plus got to learn to read, and spoke 5 languages.

Well, here's an anecdote about a mentally disturbed slave. The recently released film 12 Years a Slave tells the true story of a free man, Solomon Northup of New York, who is kidnapped into slavery. When he is first imprisoned in Washington DC, he is with a woman named Eliza, who is in her mid-20s and has 2 children aged about 7 and 10. While they were slaves, she lived with her master in a separate house as his lover, and was well-treated, as were her children. Then they were all abruptly sold to a particularly nasty slaver and were transported to Louisiana. Then they were split up, with the mother very powerfully and tearfully resisting separation from her 2 children. Once they were split up, the film shows her in a near constant state of tears, missing her kids. The book goes into more detail: she was very depressed, and was listless and sad most of the time. She talked about her children all the time, and often talked TO them, as if they were there with her. While she was hired to work as a ladies maid, due to her behavior, she was sent to work in the fields. She was no good there either due to her obvious mental issues. Now keep in mind that the master she had there was described by the book's author, Solomon Northup, as the best, most "Christian", good man he had ever met in his whole life. The man had even tried to buy the woman's daughter to keep them together, but the slaver wouldn't sell the daughter because she was a beautiful girl (remember, age 7) so in a few years he was sure he could sell her to men for $5000.   So what did this paragon of wonderful slave ownership do when his slave was depressed because her children were taken away from her and she'd never see them again? He sold her for almost nothing to a cruel master who whipped her a lot to get her to do anything. But she didn't really respond to whipping, either. Eventually she just lay down in the slave quarters and didn't get up. The other slaves tried to feed her and take care of her, but she was not very responsive, and after awhile in this semi-catatonic state, she died, only around 2 years after her children were taken from her, still in her 20s. So that's what you get from a master that a slave described as being one of the best.

Here's another example: Dr. J. Marion Sims, father of American gynecology, put the word out that he wanted to buy slaves suffering from "female troubles". So he bought such women, and did surgical experiments on them, on slave babies, and on non-enslaved women too, since by law a husband could ask a doctor to perform surgery on his wife, and she had no legal say in the matter. He performed over 30 surgeries on one enslaved woman. No anesthesia.

Then there's drapetomania, which a doctor declared to be a mental disorder among slaves that caused them to want to run away. He was laughed at my most other doctors for this, but it shows the mindset that anyone even entertained this idea as being in the least legitimate.
