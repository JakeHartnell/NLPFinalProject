It is important to remember that the Kingdom of Jerusalem lasted for almost 200 years during which a portion of the waves of Crusaders from Europe stayed behind in the Holy Land with new lands and titles.  The knights that stayed lived the rest of their lives there, their children were born there and lived and died there.  As a result they adopted eastern modes of dress and grooming.  The Franks trimmed their long hair and beards in the Eastern style and took to new fabrics like silk, satin and colorful dyes.  In respect to armor the Crusaders' mail proved to be extremely effective against the Muslims so why change it?  It did have a tendency to become unbearably hot in direct sunlight though so some knights wore Turkish robes and khalats over their mail to prevent this.    
##
Can you elaborate on the effectiveness of Crusader armor against Muslim weapons?
##
Various chroniclers writing in, I believe, the 12th century reported instances where armored men were shot repeatedly with arrows to virtually no effect. This comes from both Muslim and Christian sources, and is not limited solely to knights - the Muslim source was in reference to foot soldiers. Presumably, they were wearing a variety of padded armor either over or under mail - a gambeson, aketon, subarmalis, what have you.
##
Let me reverse OPs question, then. What changes in weapons or armor did Muslim warriors incorporate in reaction to Crusader armies?

Also, was mail not used in Muslim armies?
##
During the time of the crusades armour changed quite a bit, but if that was due to meeting the new foes or not I cannot say. 
Perhaps the biggest change was the appearance of face-plates and protection for the face in the late XII century and the appearance of the so called kettle hat in the early-mid XIII-th century. A pretty cool resource from that transitional time is the [Maciejowski bible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Bible), commissioned by the french king Lois IX, himself a crusader. It was made in the first half of the XIII-th century and is an extremely detailed resource on everything ranging from armour to lanterns. 
[On this image](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Morgan_Bible_10r.jpg)you can see a depiction of both older style of armour -  the guys with the nasal helms, and newer fashions - the kettle hat and the full helm covering the face of the knight. The XIII-th century also saw the introduction of rigid limb defences - again Maciejowski is one of the earliest sources showing these - [for example](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Goliath_challenges_the_Israelites_(Maciejowski_Bible).PNG) and [rigid body protection](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2744/4329165066_88a2abf4b1_z.jpg) which would eventually give rise to all the nice plate armour of later times. 

Swords also changed quite a bit during that time, with the appearance of the iconic [Great Swords and Bastard Swords](http://www.myarmoury.com/feature_spotxii.html) in the late XII-th century, which would eventually go on to become the longswords of the XIV,XV and XVIth centuries. 

Another thing that appeared during that time was the time when the combination of sword and buckler became popular, and the second half of the XIII-th century is presumably the time when the author of the [oldest known fencing manual](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Armouries_Ms._I.33) lived

Padded armour was also on the rise, and images from the XI-XII centuries are the first that I know of that show people wearing only gambesons/aketons, although subarmalises and bambikions are mentioned earlier. 

During the time of the cruades the [old norman shields](http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs12/i/2006/305/a/b/Norman_Shield_by_katsutoshi.jpg) evolved into [this](http://img65.imageshack.us/img65/8687/collarsry4.jpg) and the famous [heather shields](http://www.manningimperial.com/gallery/550main.jpg)

However these changes are not necessarily due to the crusades. Europeans fought wars all over the place, and it might just be natural evolution. And this is jsut a brief overview. 
##
Very good overview. However, I would add that, along with new forms, traditional forms of protection became more extensive. C. 1066, standard mail consisted of a coif and short-sleeved, thigh-length hauberk. Mail hauberks became generally long-sleeved at some point in the late 11th/early 12th century, and subsequently mail mittens and leggings were added to the standard kit. This is important because, as the Wisby excavations strongly indicate, the unarmored parts of the body were almost exclusively where wounds were inflicted. The leggings in particular were a bit of a mixed bag as limb armor is disproportionately fatiguing.
##
Thanks for the additions. 

&gt;The leggings in particular were a bit of a mixed bag as limb armor is disproportionately fatiguing.

Yep, I've got the impressions that whenever people went from horse to foot leg armour was one of the first thing to abandon.

They were planning to keep quiet about it. The death camps of Treblinka, Sobibor, Belzec and Chelmno were dismantled during the war and the human remains were disposed off as thoroughly as possible. Auschwitz and Majdanek were only left to be found by the outside world because the Russian advanced too quickly to have them dismantled in time (and also Auschwitz was huge, the Germans did destroy most crematoria and gas chambers before they left, though).

Head of the SS Himmler said to the SS in his [famous Poznan speech](http://www.holocaust-history.org/himmler-poznan/speech-text.shtml) on October 4, 1943:

&gt; I also want to mention a very difficult subject before you here, completely openly.
It should be discussed amongst us, and yet, nevertheless, **we will never speak about it in public.** [...] I am talking about the "Jewish evacuation": the extermination of the Jewish people. It is one of those things that is easily said. "The Jewish people is being exterminated," every Party member will tell you, "perfectly clear, it's part of our plans, we're eliminating the Jews, exterminating them, ha!, a small matter." And then along they all come, all the 80 million upright Germans, and each one has his decent Jew. They say: all the others are swine, but here is a first-class Jew.  And none of them has seen it, has endured it. Most of you will know what it means when 100 bodies lie together, when there are 500, or when there are 1000. And to have seen this through, and -- with the exception of human weaknesses -- to have remained decent, has made us hard and is a **page of glory never mentioned and never to be mentioned.** [...]
##
Since they were planning to keep quiet on it how long did it take people to find out about the death camps. Was it like an urban myth to people? I'm sure Jewish people knew they were going to work camps but did anyone know for a fact before they got there that it would be death camps? Also how did the world find out if they were meant to be secret? 
##
About the world in general finding out there's a [section in our Popular Quuestions wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/wwii#wiki_were_people_aware_of_the_holocaust_during_the_war.3F) that answers that at some length. Short answer: escapees from Auschwitz reported on it. 

&gt;  I'm sure Jewish people knew they were going to work camps but did anyone know for a fact before they got there that it would be death camps?

This depends hugely on when and where they were deported from. The death camps, Treblinka, Sobibor, Belzec, Majdanek, Chelmno and Birkenau (part of Auschwitz), were all [in Poland.](http://i.imgur.com/TzDUT.png) Therefore, the Polish Jews knew quite early on what would be awaiting them when they were being transported from the ghettos to a camp. In fact, Adam Czerniak√≥w, head of the Judenrat in the Warsaw ghetto (German-appointed Jewish Council) committed suicide on 23 July 1942 when he was asked to select children for transportation from the ghetto, because he knew what that meant. But since the Polish Jews had all been rounded up into heavily guarded ghettos before the death camps were even built, there was no escape for them. Belzec (dismantled in June 1943), Chelmno (ceased operations in March 1943 and was briefly reused in April 1944) and Majdanek (liberated in July 1944) were almost exclusively used to kill Polish Jews. 

Western European Jews generally were not aware what deportation to the East really meant until at least 1944, when only Auschwitz-Birkenau was still in operation as a death camp. There were three possible death camp destinations for Western European Jews: Treblinka and Sobibor in 1942-43, Auschwitz (1942-44). Auschwitz was, however, also a labour camp, so there was a slim chance of surviving it if you were a very lucky, healthy and young(ish) person. It would be fair to say that close to nobody transported from Western Europe to Treblinka and Sobibor would have had any idea that they were going to be killed on arrival.

The deportations of Italian and Hungarian Jews began only in late 1943 and 1944 respectively after those countries, which were originally allies of Germany, were occupied by Germany. Italian writer and Auschwitz survivor Primo Levi describes vividly in *Is this a man* how the deportees were very aware of their impending doom. Likewise, most Hungarian Jews knew what was awaiting them and frantic efforts were made to save Jews, see [Raoul Wallenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raul_Wallenberg) and other foreign diplomats, the [Kastner train](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kastner_train), etc. 



 
##
&gt; Is this a man

Just a note, the title of Primo Levi's book is [*If This is a Man*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_This_Is_a_Man).  Also, for anyone else, it's an amazing book. 
##
Sorry, yes, brain fart.
##
A good source for what at least one French Jew thought in regard to the deportation is the Diary of Helene Berr. She was a relatively well-off and well-educated young jewish women in France who kept a dairy starting just after the nazi occupation up until her eventual deportation.
##
And when was she deported and what did she write about it beforehand?
##
In the earlier sections of the journal (1942) she is aware of the nazi policies, but since she was considered to be an assimilated jew, she was left alone until the laws requiring the wearing of the yellow star were implemented. Starting in her late 1943 entries and up until her deportation on March 8th 1944, she is writing more on the morality of the french in allowing the nazi actions to occur mostly unimpeded. There is a sense that she knew she would be taken and that she wouldn't return, as she chose to give her journal to one of her families french maids. I haven't read the journal in a while, so I'm paraphrasing heavily, but it's a very interesting window on the culture of occupied france as well as the implementation of the holocaust.
##
~~Just an anecdote, but my prof lived in Poland, but was of German decent, and lived right next store basically to Chelmno.  According to him, it was built in a field he played in as a child. He said his family knew that something terrible was happening in there, though not the specifics.   His aunt tried to give someone food and water (he wasn't very clear on where this was, probably on the way in) and was hit by an SS officer with the threat that she should go away or be sent inside herself.  At the end of every class he teaches he tells his life story of growing up, living in Poland during WWII, then the Russian occupation, the German exodus and managing to get "on the right train" to head to West Germany (vs. East) and finally getting to the US.  From my understanding, he has been doing this for years so I imagine it is a somewhat accurate portrayal of his experience, though he was young when WWII broke out.~~

edit:  Definitely remembered it wrong, see bellow for his recollections.
##
One of the very few survivors of Chelmno was Simon Srebnik, who was just a young teenager at the time and was shot in the head and left for dead when the camp was being abandoned. He was interviewed at great length by Claude Lanzmann for his documentary *[Shoah](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XNIrrJe_7g)*, which I cannot recommend highly enough. The full translation of that interview is available as a [PDF](http://resources.ushmm.org/intermedia/film_video/spielberg_archive/transcript/RG60_5024/D8A39DB5-DE4C-419D-B650-5F3D448BF2EC.pdf) from the USHMM's website. 

Here Srebnik (S.S.) is in Chelmno talking with a local villager (Int) who remembered what happened during the war, PO is the interviewer. It is very clear that the villagers saw everything and knew exactly what was happening. For clarification: Chelmno was the only death camp that used gas vans instead of gas chambers. There are lots more interviews in the transcript.

----------


Int. Tell me, since you were there: why 
they would take people from the manor and 
chase them, there were screams, they would 
pile them in trucks and why would they 
drive them behind the barn? 

S.S. No, here they only brought empty trucks. 

Int. They stopped over there... 

S.S. What year was this? 

Int. '45, no '43, '44. 

S.S. In 1944 I was here, in 1943 I wasn't here.

PO. Each truck was behind the bar
n. Here they... and then they left. 

S.S. It's possible that happened in 1943. 

PO. Did they plug it in to the electricity, or was it gas? 

S.S. No, here they didn't plug it in. Bu
t there was gas that came
out of exhaust pipes 
of the trucks. The same gas th
at came out of the exhaust pipe
went through to the inside. 

PO. And there were he
rmetically-sealed doors. 

S.S. Yes, they had hermetically-sealed do
ors, closed and they dr
ove towards the forest 
4 kilometers from here. 

**Int. They went into the forest.** 
 
S.S. And during the trip the gases filled the interior...
 
**Int. And meanwhile suffocated them** 

S.S. Yes, they suffocated them. 

Int. Because when one of them disconnected
the gas... and where is the stand (?)... it 
jumped... (?) 

S.S. It wasn't... 

**Int. They shot people, they shot each other, they shot from all sides as they could.** 

S.S. At that time I wasn't here yet. 

**Int. The people crawled, crawled 
and they were black as the...**

S.S. No, no I wasn't here, I was here when
they began to build the cremation ovens. In 
the woods. That was when I arrived. In 1943, there was no cremation oven in the woods. 
 
Int. No there weren't any. There were only trucks. 

S.S. No it wasn't trucks, but they dug... what do you call it? 

**Int. Graves...**

S.S. They shot the people, then threw them in the graves. 

Int. Just like that. 

S.S. But they realized that... 

**Int. The earth moved, it rose up.**

S.S. Yes, it moved. It smelled bad. 

**Int. Yes, there was a continual fire, always, all the time.**

S.S. That's why they stopped. And they started to build the cremation ovens. You 
can't last here. 

**Int. And all that, they've dug the graves out again.**


##
Interesting read.  As I said, my professor was young (7ish), so perhaps his family tried to keep the specifics from him?

edit: I also could be remembering it wrong.  I recorded it once, but haven't listened to it in a while.
##
Certainly, I'm not disputing your professor's recollections.
##
It is really disturbing that people knew *that much* about what was going on in there.  From the way my Professor described his area/village it sounded very small and very insular.  He was raised Anabaptist and his family was very religious. I can't really imagine what it would be like for a town like that to all of a sudden have something so disturbing as an extermination camp nearby. 
##
Here's another interview with a villager from Chelmno, from the same PDF. C.L. is Claude Lanzmann, B. (Barbara) is the interpreter, G.B is the villager. This shows you how the villagers explained to themselves why this was happening.

C.L. Barbara, ask them‚Ä¶ were there as many Jews in the church as there are
Christians today?

G.B. Almost.

C.L. And how many gas trucks did they need to empty it?

G.B. About 50.

C.L. It took 50 trucks to empty it! Was there constant traffic?

G.B. Yes.

C.L. And they were just saying that they couldn‚Äôt speak to Jews, that it was forbidden.
But did they try to warn those who were waiting, even by signs?

G.B. That was absolutely forbidden.

C.L. So they didn‚Äôt even make signs?

G.B. No, you risked being shot‚Ä¶ shot in the head.

[...]



C.L. Ask them‚Ä¶ in their opinion, why did this happen to the Jews?

G.B. There were quite a few Poles who were exterminated‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs true‚Ä¶ so he‚Äôs going
to tell you what one of his friends told him; it happened in Majdanek, near Warsaw.

C.L. Go ahead.

G.B. So the Jews from Majdanek were grouped in a place and the rabbi wanted to talk
to them. He asked an SS officer, ‚Äúcan I talk to them,‚Äù and the officer replied, ‚Äúyes.‚Äù So
the rabbi said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a very, very long time, about two thousand years, since the Jews
condemned the perfectly innocent Christ to death‚Ä¶‚Äù So when they did that, when they
condemned him to death, they cried, ‚ÄúMay his blood fall on our heads and those of our
sons.‚Äù

C.L. Yes, yes.

G.B. So the rabbi‚Ä¶ he‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ told them, ‚ÄúPerhaps the moment has arrived. His
blood must fall upon our heads, so do nothing, go ahead, do what they ask of us‚Ä¶ here
we go.‚Äù

C.L. So, he thought that the Jews were atoning for the death of Christ?

G.B. He‚Ä¶ he doesn‚Äôt believe it‚Ä¶ and he doesn‚Äôt think that Christ would seek
revenge‚Ä¶ no, he doesn‚Äôt hold that opinion, it‚Äôs the rabbi who said that.

C.L. Oh! The rabbi said that!

G.B. It was the will of the gods, simple as that.

##
It says Jews in the church.  Were they hiding in the church?  Are those local Jews?  
##
The Jews were rounded up in the church before being gassed. There was no large purpose-built camp at Chelmno, only some barracks for the stolen goods. The Jews were transported there and immediately gassed. During the first phase of operations they would be gathered in the German confiscated manor house, while in 1944 the church was used for this purpose.
##
Something about the Old or New Testament that is most shocking to believers and none believers alike?
##
Thanks for the softball to start off, I'm still on my first cup of coffee:) 

The thing that I've often found that shocks people who are acculturated with the biblical narrative is that they are surprised when they look carefully into the gospel accounts by how rough Jesus' relationship with other people was purported to be during his lifetime. I think that most people had an idea that the Jewish religious leaders in the area are depicted as his staunch opponents, but often aren't aware of stuff like this:

**Mark 3:21:** His close family (or relations or associates; arguments over how to render Œø·º± œÄŒ±œÅ‚Äô Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·ø¶ are intense and very theologically charged because they have the potential to cast aspersion on the "holy family") thinks Jesus is insane. 

**Luke 4:28-29** Jesus' fellow townspeople attempt to murder him after one of his initial sermons.

**Matthew 8:34:** After causing considerable destruction of property in the act of healing a man, Jesus is basically told to get out of town by the people of the area.

I think a lot of Christians (and maybe even non-religious people) have a really rosy picture of Jesus where he's universally loved and respected except by a few grouchy hypocrites, then suddenly the government kills him. That's not the picture that emerges from a close reading.
##
Sort of building off this (but turning it around to the statements ascribed to *Jesus himself*), we also have things like:

&gt;If anyone comes to Me, and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be My disciple (Luke 14.26)

...and the incident with the Syrophoenician woman in Mark 7. The exact meaning of this incident is *very* hotly debated...but the surface reading seems to be that, after this woman requests healing from Jesus, he actually refuses at first, saying

&gt;‚ÄúLet the children [=*Israelites*?] be satisfied first, for it is not good to take the children‚Äôs bread and throw it to the dogs [=Gentiles?].‚Äù

This seeming blanket rejection of helping this Gentile is quite interesting. 

EDIT: /u/Soul_Anchor astutely pointed out that it was a *diminutive* form of the word "dog" used here. Interestingly, Betsworth (2010:131) notes that there are in fact *several* diminutives used in woman's response; and she argues that "the Koine Greek of Mark's time often did not retain the sense of a smaller version of the original," and that "the term is not used to soften the impact of the epithet, but rather. . .it is a part of [Mark's] strategy to retain the focus on the [little] girl."
##
Regarding the first quote, it was my impression that it's a matter of translation; the original word used where we have "to hate" actually meant "to love less than", so Jesus was saying you have to love God/him more than your father, mother etc. Thoughts?

Regarding the second quote, could you give an overview of the suggested meanings that are debated?

Thanks!

##
MŒπœÉŒ≠œâ (mis-eh-oh, the origin of half of the words misanthrope, misogynist, etc.) can mean "love less," but hate isn't a wrong translation either, and it's the first one listed in modern lexicons.
##
It's quite clear that this is a Semitism here (falling within the range of meanings of ◊©◊†◊ê/◊°◊†◊î as a quasi-technical term - and/or as something like "demote").
##
So, would you agree that "hate" is the most probable rendering then, trending along the lines of ◊©◊†◊ê?
##
I'm confident enough of it being a Semitism to where I'm not inherently opposed to alternate renderings - though I'm not exactly sure what a good one would be. "Demote"? Meh. Or, perhaps - taking poetic liberty (though perhaps not as much as one would think) - "turn his back on"? Though if I were doing a formal translation, I'd definitely have a footnote here.
##
A stronger rendering definitely comes to loggerheads with the passage about "hating anyone" in 1st John.
##
&gt;‚ÄúLet the children [=Israelites?] be satisfied first, for it is not good to take the children‚Äôs bread and throw it to the dogs [=Gentiles?].‚Äù

It should be noted that Jesus pulls back by using the diminutive form of the word "dog", which means something akin to "puppy".
##
Indeed! Œ∫œÖŒΩ·Ω±œÅŒπŒøŒΩ.

Interestingly, Betsworth (2010:131) notes that there in fact *several* diminutives used in woman's response; but she argues that "in the Koine Greek of Mark's time [diminutive endings] often did not retain the sense of a smaller version of the original," and that "the term is not used to soften the impact of the epithet, but rather. . .it is a part of [Mark's] strategy to retain the focus on the [little] girl."
##
Isn't it a humbleness in perspective though? I always thought that was the reason for the answer. 
##
Yeah, I actually went ahead and deleted that part of my answer...I have a speculative idea about what's really going on there; but I won't air the thought until it's been through the trial of peer review. I'd tentatively say that the "humility" aspect is indeed what's going on.
##
Regarding the final comment
&gt; I think a lot of Christians (and maybe even non-religious people) have a really rosy picture of Jesus where he's universally loved and respected except by a few grouchy hypocrites, then suddenly the government kills him. That's not the picture that emerges from a close reading.

What is the picture of Jesus that emerges from a close reading?
##
Of course, few ideas in history have been as hotly debated, but I'd have to say that the historical Jesus comes across as enigmatic, stern, somewhat aloof, driven, and maybe depressed. Mark casts Jesus' mission as a warfare between God through Jesus, and other powers that seek to control humans (demons, worldly authorities, etc.). Because this is the earliest gospel, it's hard to know if the other author's softening of some of Jesus' hard edges are indicative of reality as depicted from other sources not trying to write a "war story," or if this is an attempt to make him more palatable to readers. It certainly has confused a lot of people.
##
Do you think that some of these verses may be polemic against a "Caliphate of James" or some other group from his family or community that tried to set themselves up as an authority in the early church?
##
The general issue of whether there are any anti-Jamesian leanings in the New Testament (outside of Paul, of course) is really interesting. I know I worked on it a bit a while back...but drawing a blank at the moment. One interesting thing that I always remembered though was that the name "James" *doesn't appear even once in the gospel of John*. 
##
Very possibly. I haven't dug into it, but given the literature on attempts to debunk the cult of John the Baptist as a legitimate messianic group in John's gospel, I'd be astonished if this hasn't been argued in detail.
##
I'm surprised that this is a surprise to people. "a prophet in his own land" , the crowd called for his death etc.
##
I talked to a 20 year old the other day that was raised going to church every Sunday but didn't realize that Joseph wasn't supposed to be Jesus' biological father. You'd be amazed what slips through the cracks.
##
Depends if you consider the doctrine of the Virgin Birth as a later addition.
##
Of course; I just meant that he wasn't aware of what his church taught.
##
&gt; I think a lot of Christians (and maybe even non-religious people) have a really rosy picture of Jesus where he's universally loved and respected except by a few grouchy hypocrites, then suddenly the government kills him. That's not the picture that emerges from a close reading.

"If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first."

##
Gotta read that to know about it though. Most haven't.
##
Thanks for this question. I think a lot depends on the believers and non-believers. There are some non-believers who are shocked that historians think he existed, while many believers are shocked by the conclusions that historians drew about him. 

One thing that might shock both is the conclusion of historians that Jesus was not initially thought to be a pre-existent supernatural and perhaps even divine entity who took on human form. In what are likely to be our earliest Gospels (Mark, Matthew, and Luke) Jesus is not depicted as a divine figure. 

But I think that, on the whole, different things tend to shock non-believers and believers, and there are plenty of people in both categories who are well-informed about scholarship and won't be easily shocked! :-)
##
Well, while not portrayed necessarily as a divine figure, would the first chapters of Luke imply that he is certainly more than a normal and natural human figure? I am thinking specifically of the first two chapters, also known as the Annunciation, Visitation, and Magnificat. Jesus is not explicitly called God, but he is certainly portrayed as a Messiah that is more than a mere human compared to others, in particular his own mother.
##
Certainly, there are hints of what is called a "high Christology" in sections like these. As an interesting sidenote, some of these traditions in the early parts of Luke may have a connection with other texts, like those from the Dead Sea Scrolls (see 4Q246's "He will be called son of God, and they will call him son of the Most High").

I *would* say the virgin birth would be one of these particular Christian innovations that might also presume a high Christology in a way, as well - though the notion itself is probably originally dependent on the Greek translation of Isa 7:14. It's hard to say...

It remains to be seen what sort of continuity or discontinuity there is in early Christianity's  Messianic expectations (and the "nature" of the Messiah here), compared to other Jewish ideas of this.


##
I've read a lot about how the first century after the death of Jesus was characterized not only by the creation of the "christian" identity, but also the creation of a distinct jewish identity, i.e. rabbinical judaism. (If I'm wrong, please correct me. :) How much does rabbinical judaism differ from pre-christian judaism?
##
The catalyst here was really the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 CE. The main focus of Judaism in the 2nd Temple period was Temple sacrifice, and the Temple in Jerusalem was (and is) the only place where sacrifice was allowed. When the Temple was gone, and along with it the Temple authorities, (the Sadducees - the priestly class) and sacrifices could no longer be performed, the focus of worship shifted to study of Scripture and observance of law. This was a mode of worship which was already being developed in the Pharisee schools for a century, but after the destruction of the Temple, the Pharisee scholars became the "teachers" (Aramaic: *rabbis*) of the law, and this gave rise to Rabbinic Judaism.


##
I remember reading (in Josephus?) that there were Jewish temples (with sacrificial offerings) in Hellenic Egypt. Is there any evidence that these actually existed and, if so, what was their relationship to the priestly order in Jerusalem?
##
You mean the [Land of Onias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_Onias)?


Yeah, that appears to have been a real Temple, for a while. Vespasian destroyed it too, but even when it was operational, it was still thought necessary to sacrifice at the Temple in Jerusalem. It wasn't seen as a sufficient replacement, but more as a comfort. 
##
Yes; it's perhaps a little-known fact that the Yahweh religion ("Judaism" is a bit of an anachronism) wasn't restricted to the temple in Jerusalem, even though the scriptures in their canonical form insisted that Jerusalem was the only legitimate place of worship.

In the Persian period, contemporary with the rebuilt Jerusalem temple, there was a major temple at Mt. Gerizim that lasted into Hasmonean times, and another at Elephantine in Egypt, where an ancient corpus of letters between the priests of Elephantine and Jerusalem has been discovered. There was also a Hellenistic temple at Leontopolis, near Heliopolis, which may have had the approval of the diaspora Jews in Alexandria, but not of the Jerusalem priesthood or the Hasmonean rulers.

Much of the theology of the Deuteronomic History (Deuteronomy through Kings) seems to be intent on denying the validity of any Yahweh worship outside of Jerusalem, which is why the Samaritans eventually rejected all these books except Deuteronomy.

There were also factions, like the Essenes, that didn't think any of the temples were legitimate. Judaism was much more diverse and widespread than people tend to realize, since we only read the version canonized by the "winning" faction in our Bibles.

Yep.  Have a look [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephantine_papyri).  A temple seems to have existed, though its relationship with Jerusalem is unclear.
##
Was there ever a time that they just built an altar somewhere and used that to make sacrifices (eg I don't recall Abraham taking Isaac to a temple)? Why couldn't the Jews just return to offering sacrifices outside the temple?
##
The Israelites were doing that quite frequently during the time of the Judges, utilizing what the bible calls ◊ë◊û◊ï◊™ -- bamot or "high places" -- and they continue to do so even after the establishment of the Temple, despite the prohibition of the Torah and the protest of most prophets.

In a fully "obedient" society, there are only two sacrifices that can be offered outside of the Temple, namely the ◊§◊®◊î ◊ê◊ì◊ï◊û◊î - Para Aduma or red heifer - and the Paschal lamb (in modern times, there are groups of Jews who make attempts to bring the pascal sacrifice each year, but are generally prevented by the Israeli police as religious tensions would likely explode).

&gt;I don't recall Abraham taking Isaac to a temple

Just for fun, rabbinic literature tends to tie multiple events back to the Temple mount. So according to that tradition, Abraham did in fact take his son to the spot that the Temple would eventually be built on (what with the mountain being innately holy and all, it must have always been that way).
##
It should be noted that the canon of the Hebrew Bible was selected by people from Judah (which contained Jerusalem), and perhaps does not completely represent the customs of the Israel during the period of the prophets. The book of Amos, for instance, mentions that Israel had centres of worship at Bethel, Gilgal and Dan.
##
&gt;I've read a lot about how the first century after the death of Jesus was characterized not only by the creation of the "christian" identity, but also the creation of a distinct jewish identity, i.e. rabbinical judaism. (If I'm wrong, please correct me.)

To add on to /u/brojangles, Jewish texts don't really talk much about Jesus or Christianity until much later.  The references to Jesus or Christianity are mostly vague enough that they're not definitley about Jesus.

&gt;How much does rabbinical judaism differ from pre-christian judaism?

It's tough to say, because we don't know a ton about pre-Rabbinic Judaism.  The biggest change would be that Rabbinic Judaism represents a small subset of earlier Judaism.  The Temple's destruction was a big shift, but most day-to-day change would be loss of diversity of belief, or gradual changes.

Wow, what a great panel!

* The Gospel John is, I believe, often said to be rather divergent with the other Gospels in many different ways--water into wine is one example, another being Lazarus. Is there a standard explanation for this? Did it come from a radically different environment? Why was it included in the New Testament if it is inconsistent?

* Who were the Pharisees, really? How did they interact with the wider Mediterranean intellectual elite? Was there a landed, Hellenistic elite in Judea?

* I recently heard a very interesting reading of Revelations as being an anti-imperialist, which I found fascinating because I usually have thought it to be fairly boilerplate moralizing, Rome' significance only as the center of immorality. is this a common reading in Biblical studies?

* Actually, on that topic, how do you usually see early Christian interacting with the Empire? I feel the general stereotype that it was entirely antagonistic is rather complicated by Paul's Roman citizenship and Tertullian.

* How did the Maccabees mange to be so succesful against the Seleucids?

* And particularly for /u/Flubb, can you give a description of the archaeological controversy over David's Empire? I hear about it from time to time but would love a nice unified summary.

EDIT: more:

* Super broad, and from conversations with NT scholars, quite unanswerable, but just to test the waters: when is it fair to say Christianity was no longer just a sect of Judaism?

* What effect on the relation between northern ans southern Judea did the Assyrian conquest have?

* Do we have preserved any voices arguing against Paul's (I think) decision to extent Jesus' teaching to gentiles?

* Just kind of a general question, when did people start using the word "Christianity" as opposed to, for example, "the Word of Christ" or "the true teaching"? It seems to me to mark a pretty a pretty big distinction in the way Christianity is thought about.
##
&gt;Is there a standard explanation for this?

Yes, but you aren't going to like it. Basically, the notion is that the Synoptics are working with Q, a collection of Jesus sayings gathered from people who actually heard them and used as an evangelistic tool, and their own material (or Mark), John is getting his information from "somewhere different." More than that can't really be said, but to me, this stock answer is almost the logical equivalent of the "begging the question," fallacy. "They had different sources because they include radically different things because they had different sources..." you get my drift. Sadly, the true source of John's divergent gospel is probably lost forever in the mist of history.

&gt;Why was it included in the New Testament if it is inconsistent?

A big decider in the inclusion of certain texts at the closing of the canon was their broad acceptance by the church. It's a mistake to think that there was heated debate about the content of the NT when the canon was finally decided; most of the books everyone agreed upon, and this was one of them. How it gained prominence despite its divergent story and very different presentation of Jesus is a bit more of a conundrum, but its uniqueness has had a humorous effect on scholars throughout the ages. For example, in the 18th Century, an early member of the text criticism movement, Friedrich Ernst Schleiermacher, expressed the commonly held opinion that John was the earliest Gospel, because it contained the most well organized discourses, clearest appeals to Jesus divinity, and most instances of miracles. Today, virtually all scholars regard it as the latest of the gospels FOR THE EXACT SAME REASONS. How's that for irony?
##
Sorry to push the question, but your initial answer is so captivating! Can you provide any information on how the four gospels came to be prominent, especially concerning John and its uniqueness?
##
&gt; I recently heard a very interesting reading of Revelations as being an anti-imperialist, which I found fascinating because I usually have thought it to be fairly boilerplate moralizing, Rome' significance only as the center of immorality. is this a common reading in Biblical studies?

Certainly the "anti-imperial" nature intersects with its "moralizing." But there seems to be a preponderance of *specific Roman figures/emperors hinted at* in Revelation. Probably the most famous of these is the [identification of the "number of the beast," 666, with Nero](http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/comments/1fz5qo/as_we_near_666_subscribers_a_thread_on_666/). Just this year, there was a very comprehensive treatment done on anti-Roman aspects of Revelation: Judy Diehl's "'Babylon': Then, Now and 'Not Yet': Anti-Roman Rhetoric in the Book of Revelation" (also, see things like Koester's "Roman Slave Trade and the Critique of Babylon in Revelation 18").

Another interesting avenue of exploration is that the Revelation may actually be indebted to ideas that appear in pre-Christian Jewish texts - like those among the Dead Sea Scrolls - that have a very anti-Roman attitude (see the Qumran War Scroll, 1QM).
##
The connection with the Dead Sea Scrolls was one of the points raised, and I found the argument in general quite intriguing. I had never really thought of using Jewish literature as a source of subaltern voice for the Roman Empire, which I guess goes to show how unfamiliar with it I am, and the idea seems pretty exciting. I'll definitely follow those up.

Is the 666 as Nero reading fairly widely accepted? As Nero seems to have been fairly popular in the Hellenic provinces, it seems that this is a pretty interesting reaction to Greek influence, or perhaps a simply unspecified bit of anger against the Imperial power structure in general.
##
&gt;I'll definitely follow those up.

A good source on this is David Aune's "Qumran and the Book of Revelation" (and perhaps Elgvin's "Priests on Earth as in Heaven: Jewish Light on the Book of Revelation" - especially the section "War Ideology, Persecution and Antagonism"). 

&gt;Is the 666 as Nero reading fairly widely accepted?

Indeed - I haven't really seen any significant challenges to it that are as plausible. The clincher seems to be the variant 616 (I think I talked about all this [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/comments/1fz5qo/as_we_near_666_subscribers_a_thread_on_666/)). 
##
&gt;Super broad, and from conversations with NT scholars, quite unanswerable, but just to test the waters: when is it fair to say Christianity was no longer just a sect of Judaism?

As soon as the rise of a theology of Jesus that included his divinity was in play. Maybe around the time of Revelation or the Ascension of Isaiah, if not earlier. This is just my opinion, however.

&gt;Do we have preserved any voices arguing against Paul's (I think) decision to extent Jesus' teaching to gentiles?

Not that I know of; we have to "mirror read" those out of our extant literature.

&gt;Just kind of a general question, when did people start using the word "Christianity" as opposed to, for example, "the Word of Christ" or "the true teaching"?

Acts 11:26-and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.

So the answer, very early. I don't know if it's even possible to examine Christianity apart from that label except in theory.
##
&gt;Who were the Pharisees, really? How did they interact with the wider Mediterranean intellectual elite? Was there a landed, Hellenistic elite in Judea?

I'd recommend looking at Neusner's *[From Politics to Piety: The Emergence of Pharisaic Judaism](http://www.amazon.com/From-Politics-Piety-Emergence-Pharisaic/dp/1592441491)*, but in short, they most likely begin as a loose guild of legalistic scribes (probably beginning with Ezra the Scribe) that find power with the Maccabean period and start to enforce their opinions in the law, but in a populist fashion that endears them to the people as anyone could join them. This was a natural source of conflict with the Sadducee given their more traditional role as teachers of law (being a priest and a scribe were not necessarily mutually exclusive, but no non-priest would have been sadduceean).

&gt;How did the Maccabees mange to be so succesful against the Seleucids?

Success is relative. How did they win the war? Guerrilla warfare works wonders, as do tax issues and other administrative and political issues happening concurrently, but it still took well over a decade of struggle with hellenizers and the Seleucids themselves to officially win their full independence (which lasted for a little while before the dynasty devolved into civil wars and infighting).
##
&gt;Who were the Pharisees, really? How did they interact with the wider Mediterranean intellectual elite? Was there a landed, Hellenistic elite in Judea?

They were a Jewish faction in the late second temple era, and the only group that survived the era significantly.  They seem to have interacted with cultures more widely to an extent, but they weren't the elite early on--that was more the Sadducees' thing.  They'd be the primary interactors with other cultures in the Hellenistic world, though the Pharisees definitely did too (Rabbis going to baths, Greek words in their texts, etc).

&gt;How did the Maccabees mange to be so succesful against the Seleucids?

This is outside my specialty, but it's my understanding that their empire was more or less collapsing.  Their weakness allowed a revolt to eventually succeed against them.
##
&gt;the only group that survived the era significantly

Can you elaborate on this? I am pretty unfamiliar with Second Temple Judaism.
##
What are the earliest documents/evidence you could point to that talk about the nature of the Eucharist and early Christian worship practices in general? I'm curious as to how the earliest of early Christians did these things and what they thought about them. Was Transubstantiation a given for them, or was there more variation of opinion? Is there anything that points to these things earlier than Justin Martyr's account of Christian worship?
##
&gt; Was Transubstantiation a given for them, or was there more variation of opinion?

It certainly seems to have become quite literal already by the time of Ignatius (a bit before Justin). 

There are so many problems with trying to discern the original "function" of the Eucharist/the intention of the Eucharistic narrative. I mean, it appears as a common "ritual" already in 1 Corinthians, which is still one of the earliest Christian texts we have. Of course, it isn't until the Gospels some years later that we have an actual *narrative context* for the Last Supper. 

Then we have John 6, where these words are ascribed to Jesus:

&gt; I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves.	
	
&gt;He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.

Although this seems to be about as "literal" as you can get, I'm not totally sure. Plus, this saying *doesn't occur in the context of the Last Supper*. I wrote a little post discussing this saying in John in conjunction with verses from the book of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus) [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/comments/175t2k/he_who_eats_my_flesh_and_drinks_my_blood_john_6/).

&gt;Come to me, you who desire me, and from my produce be filled...*Those who eat me* will hunger [for more], and *those who drink me* will thirst [for more]. (Sirach 24.19, 21)

____

Some good (recent) scholarly sources that address the general topic of the develop of early Christian ideas of the Eucharist are Smith's *From Symposium to Eucharist: The Banquet in the Early Christian World*, McGowan's *Ascetic Eucharists: Food and Drink in Early Christian Ritual Meals*, Schwiebert's *Knowledge and the Coming Kingdom: The Didache's Meal Ritual and its Place in Early Christianity*.
##
Presumably you'll want to focus on 1 Corinthians 11, which is our earliest source related to the Lord's supper. The Didache also has an interestingly different set of customs related to the practice.
##
Speaking of,  what's the current theory on the dates of the Didache, particularly compared to the Paulune texts? 
##
I think most scholars would say that it's a few decades later than Paul.
##
This is one of those interesting cases - dare I say somewhat similar to the Gospel of Thomas? - where a lot of different datings have been proposed: with some proposing *very early* dates for material in the document that's totally independent from the gospels and quite archaic, but others proposing dependence on the gospels, etc. (Although I think the tide may have shifted with GThom - culminating in Goodacre's  recent *Thomas and the Gospels*).
##
As a follow up: Do we know if (or how) the Eucharist was influenced by Hellenistic mystery religions? Could it have originated from the Bread of the Presence eaten by the Temple priesthood?
##
Again, some of this is going to depend on what the original *intention* of the Eucharist was - historical data that we don't really have good access to. 

Aaaand again, it's only the Gospel of John - not in the Synoptic gospels, or in Paul - that *really* hammers home the idea that Jesus' flesh and blood *is* food and drink.

I think it's entirely plausible that the community/author(s) behind the Gospel of John was familiar in some way with some iteration(s) of the Hellenistic mysteries, as displayed in certain instances in the gospel. I'm not ready to say that this is the background of these *Eucharistic* traditions, though. Scholarship has normally been opposed to this (though not really able to pinpoint *any* good origin for it).

Though I must confess that I haven't fully worked through the material yet. Some good - and overlooked - places to start are Obbink's article "Dionysus Poured Out: Ancient and Modern Theories of Sacrifice and Cultural Formation" and Klauck's article "Presence in the Lord's Supper: 1 Corinthians 11:23-26 in the Context of Hellenistic Religious History"
##
Do historians or biblical critics give any weight to Margaret Barker's idea that there was a Temple mystery, suppressed as part of Josiah's reforms, that influenced early Christianity?
##
Ahhh, I wish I could get to this. I actually have one of her books, but I've never gotten around to reading it (though it intersects with my own interests in several ways).

I'd be curious as to what exactly she proposes this "temple mystery" was. I know she kinda went off the deep end with a few things; so there's probably reason to be cautious. I can certainly respond to a more specific proposal of hers, though - or if you post this on /r/AcademicBiblical, I'm sure someone will get back to you in the next day or so.
##
This is a question that used to bother me for years, and kind of still lingers in the back of my mind: With all the scholarship surrounding the bible, and with so many extremely well educated people that disagree on it how is a normal person to know what to believe when they read the bible? I don't know Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic etc so how deep into scholarship do I have to go just to be able to read the bible and trust the information in it? I get lost just in the maze of all the different translation arguments. 
##
What a fantastic question! Scholarship in all fields proceeds by individual scholars trying to come up with new ideas and challenges to established views. There is no way to embrace that contradictory mess, and no reason one should! The other major part of the scholarly enterprise is that the academy then evaluates what scholars published, and more often than not, what we've come up with is not found persuasive. And so the best approach is to not try to follow all the latest publications or sensational headlines, and to look instead at what the consensus is among scholars, if there is one. Specialist encyclopedia, dictionary, and textbook entries are often the best place to find this sort of information. If there isn't a consensus, it almost certainly means that the evidence is not decisive one way or the other. If there is, then it might still change in light of new evidence and arguments, but it is the best estimation of the experts based on the information currently available, and that is what the general public ought to be focusing on.
##
Do you have some recommendations for periodicals, websites, books, that you would suggest for the average bible reader that will enhance our basic understanding? 

Thanks for your reply. 
##
There are sources such as the Journal of Biblical Literature or Biblical Archaeology Review which can be good for seeing what the latest developments are. But it is better for most people to focus more on what the consensus of scholars is, rather than new proposals which may or may not pan out. And so textbooks and reference works are often the best place to look for those. The Anchor Bible Dictionary is fairly comprehensive, but also quite large and likely to be on the reference shelf at some local library. For online information, consulting a textbook by a mainstream scholar via Google Books can also be useful.

Several Biblical scholars including myself maintain blogs, and so you can often learn a fair amount about both the consensus and the current debates by reading some of them - often in relatively succinct form.
##
Thanks for the great follow up. 
##
My first recommendation is usually James Kugel's [How to Read the Bible: A Guide to Scripture, Then and Now](http://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Bible-Guide-Scripture/dp/0743235878). It's an appropriate introductory text that gives most people a pretty good understanding of the general approach to biblical scholarship and to what degree we interact with the biblical texts.
##
I can't promise I won't come back with more questions, but immediately springing to mind:

1. Was Mass originally in Latin and if not why did it change? (I've been told it was originally in Greek, but never from a reliable source)

2. Is it true that the Greek in the New Testament (especially the Gospels) is particularly poor?

3. Of the books that didn't make it into the New Testament, were very many close (or for that matter, were there any that did make it in that were on the verge of not)?

Sorry for asking all these questions at once, I've had these floating in my mind for a while.
##
I'll let someone who studies church history and the history of liturgy chime in on the first question - I think it is safe to say that there were Christians using Aramaic and Syriac, Greek, Latin, and Coptic from early on as they developed their practices in regions where those languages predominated.

In answer to question 2, that generalization is too broad. Revelation is particularly awkward, while Luke and Hebrews are quite polished and eloquent. There is a spectrum, reflecting the Greek education of the various authors.

There are some books which only barely made it in (Hebrews, for instance, and Revelation), and a very small number which seem to have had a serious shot at being included, such as the Didache and the Shepherd of Hermas. 
##
Thanks for your answers.

Would the theology in the books that almost got in sound strange to modern Christians? I'm just wondering how close the beliefs were to going in a totally different direction.
##
You can read them online: [1 Clement](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/1clement.html), [The Shepherd of Hermas](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/shepherd.html), [Barnabas](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/barnabas.html), [Didache](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/didache.html). They're not really all that "out there."  Many are/were still widely read in Christian churches.
##
Some of the texts that got in sound pretty strange to modern Christians, when they actually read them carefully! :-)

But you can see for yourself what some of them sound like on sites like this one: http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/
##
Is it possible to find a New Testament translation where the translator has tried to maintain the "tone" of each book? All the translations I've read have been uniformly polished and formal.
##
I won't take a swing at the first one; I don't know much about the early history of the liturgy.

&gt;Is it true that the Greek in the New Testament (especially the Gospels) is particularly poor?

This is an area that is very hotly debated among scholars. The gospels themselves are written in a form of Greek called Koine (pronounced coin-ay), or "common" Greek, which is itself a descendant of the older Greek of  writers like Aeschylus. This form of the language was spread across the Levant, where the Bible was written, by the famous Macedonian King Alexander the Great, who set up models of the Greek Polis, complete with Greek as the language of business and politics, in many of the regions he conquered. The difference between Koine and Ancient Greek (sometimes dubiously called "Attic") is vaguely analogous to the difference between the English of Beowulf and the English of Chaucer. Some already see this development into a more "vulgar" form of Greek as a lowering of the language. You won't see halmarks of great ancient Greek, like beautiful ring composition, in the Gospels.

However, considered within the boundaries of Koine style itself the discussion gets more heated. The Gospel of Mark, virtually universally regarded as the oldest extant "life of Jesus," comes under fire in particular for some clumsy language and occasionally jarring transitions (go through a modern English bible with a highlighter and see how often the word "immediately" forms a bridge between events). It's not very good Greek, even as a work in Koine.

However recently some scholars, like the unfortunately named Dennis Ronald MacDonald, have argued that Mark contains a substantial amount of literary artistry, and is actually making strange language choices and laying out a confusing narrative to paint Jesus as a sort of Homeric hero. I know that the doctoral student T. Michael. W. Halcolmb has presented papers in the last few years arguing that the language Mark has been unjustly categorized as clumsy; I'm not entirely convinced yet, but that camp is out there.

Luke cleans things up a bit. He seems to be somewhat more educated (by his own admission his work is commissioned by someone else, though in agreeing with the veracity of that assertion I'm also taking a position on a debated point). He touches up language he borrows from Mark; "seas" become "lakes," which is what they really are, and so on.

Other works are a mixed bag. Revelation is pretty darn bad, particularly in its frequent use of "Semitisms" (constructions that make sense in Hebrew/Aramaic but not in Greek) The Epistle to the Hebrews is very good.

I suppose the TL;DR here is that the Greek in the gospels is a mixed bag tending towards mediocre, some is good, some is not. Remember that these books were published in a time and place were study of ancient texts indicates that some government officials were not  literate enough to sign their own opinions into law coherently or answer simple questions from higher officials, so saying that the gospels are "poor" really has to be put into perspective.

&gt;Of the books that didn't make it into the New Testament, were very many close

The ones that were very close (so close that they made it into some codices before official canon decisions were made) are still available today (Didache, Shepherd of Hermas), and I think most scholars would agree that they represent very strong theological overlap with texts that were accepted. I'm actually working on a translation of the Didache right now, and it is most fascinating for the fact that it seems to be a non-Pauline order of Christian life for converts; one without the theological influence of Paul, which I'd argue that few if any later documents can boast. 

Sure, these two works have some theological oddities (Koine Lingua and I have been messaging back and forth about one), but no more than Revelation, which was probably the nearest of the included NT books to getting voted off the island. Some of the stuff in there is very hard to square with what's in the other parts of the New Testament.

Thanks for making my spit out my drink with the Dennis MacDonald comment. 

I'll only add that there's also been quite a bit of work done recently along similar lines, but focusing on *Acts* (of the Apostles) in conjunction with Homeric narrative, et al. I think, in significant ways, a better case can be made for intertextuality *here*.

Haha, but speaking of Mark...I encountered a pretty crazy article recently. I'm not sure I buy it at all, but it's certainly interesting: ["Jesus and Heracles at Cadiz (ta Gadeira): Death, Myth, and Monsters at the 'Straits of Gibraltar' (Mark 4:35-5:43)"](http://www.academia.edu/3147847/_Jesus_and_Heracles_at_Cadiz_ta_Gadeira_Death_Myth_and_Monsters_at_the_Straits_of_Gibraltar_Mark_4_35-5_43_)
##
Has there been any attempt to connect the style of the NT works to the Second Sophistic, which attempted to revive the old Attic literary language?
##
Good question. It seems to me like the NT writers, especially as they presumably operated in groups and areas that were somewhat insular from Greek trends, were a bit early to really be in on the full swing of that movement. 

The only work I can think of right now that I've looked over that addresses this question is by BW Winter, that sees some of Paul's objections to artful speaking abilities as a requisite for respect as a shot at the sophists, while Apollos has possibly co-opted some of their rhetorical abilities to be purportedly esteemed a great speaker. If we accept the evidence-less but nonetheless popular possibility that Hebrews was a product of Apollos, that may be a direct connection between the movement and an NT work in a positive way. As it is, Paul seems to be reacting against it. 

Sorry, my work with Paul has been targeted backwards at his use of the Septuagint, away from the dates where this question would have come into play. If someone else wants to chime in though, I would absolutely love to hear more about this.

...

&gt;Revelation is pretty darn bad, particularly in its frequent use of "Semitisms" (constructions that make sense in Hebrew/Aramaic but not in Greek)

Is it seen as a possibility that some of these issues could stem from being translated from another language?  Like do some of the semitisms in Revelation imply that all or part of the text may have originally been in one of those languages? Same with some of the gospel texts, since Jesus would have spoken Aramaic, some translation would have had to take place along the way. 
##
With Jesus' words, it's almost a no-brainer. Early stories even translate his Aramaic during encounters with people; Jesus definitely spoke Aramaic, which might have been responsible for some of the clumsy language. More relevant, however, is that the Gospels and Revelation (which were almost certainly composed in Greek as Greek documents) were written by writers who were steeped in and used to the phraseology of Aramaic and what we'd now call the documents contained in the "Hebrew Bible" or "Old Testament." If you're trying to tell an addendum to God's story, you're going to use the language that you, and readers of that kind of story, are familiar with, using stock phrases associated with that kind of work.
##
&gt; ...but no more than Revelation, which was probably the nearest of the included NT books to getting voted off the island. Some of the stuff in there is very hard to square with what's in the other parts of the New Testament.

Could you expand on this part a bit more, if you don't mind? How doesn't it square with other things that were included? Do you mean linguistically, narratively, theologically?
##
The theology is the big one. Understanding that we're now stepping outside the realm of historical questions and into the realm of theological questions (inasmuch as they can be divided), the following stand out to me:

1. There is some confusion towards the end of Revelation about whether Jesus or God is on the throne of Heaven. If you read the Enochic literature that was produced by some Jewish authors centuries prior to and during Jesus life, you can see that the Jewish conception is that anyone who even vaguely attempted to usurp the authority of God in the throne room was in for a bad time. The gospels bear that distinction out: Jesus is always and everywhere either deferential or subservient to the Father (even when "all authority had been given" to him, it was still given by God), and Paul always roots Jesus' power in Jesus' father, so for Revelation to get so close to conflating or confusing Jesus and God the Father is actually a huge theological break from earlier Christian works.

2. The emphasis on vengeance is pretty novel. The "little apocalypse" of Mark and the destruction of the world in the Petrine literature point to bad times at the end of the world, but the idea that this would become such a focused expression of vengeance against people who had harmed the saints was clearly a product of hurting Christians yearning for retaliation against their Roman oppressors. You don't see martyrs like Stephen or Jesus crying out to God to spill the blood of their attackers.

3. It includes elements of Jewish apocalyptic (again, Enochic literature, but very similar to Daniel also) in a way that no other vision of the end in the NT had done. It certainly is a world away from First Thessalonians, for example.
##
1. We don't know exactly how the Mass developed, but the first Christian communities and scriptures, including liturgical formulas for the Eucharist, were all in Greek, so the first masses were almost certainly in Greek. It then changed to Latin after it was centralized in Rome, and Latin, by then, was the "English" of its day. The translation of the Greek scriptures into Vulgar ("common") Latin made them more accessible to believers at the time.

2. Some are better than others. Revelation is notoriously bad in Greek, but it gets cleaned up in translations. Markl is somewhat crude in style, but also employs complex literary structure called [chiasms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiastic_structure) which show a great deal of education and sophistication. It is likely that he was using a simpler, cruder style as a literary affect (like Mark Twain using Huck Finn's voice, for instance). Luke is very educated, if long winded, John is the most poetic. Paul comes off (in my opinion) as more angry in the Greek, sort of a ranter.

3. Religion prof got this one. Revelation and Hebrews were the most contested. The Didache and Shepherd of Hermes were the near misses.
##
Was early Judaism ever polythesitic or henothestic? If so, how did it develop into a monotheistic faith? What impact did other religions in the ancient Middle East have on the development of Judaism?

The religion of ancient Israel seems clearly to not have been monotheistic during much of its history - the archaeological evidence and the Biblical texts agree on that. The only real debate is whether it ought to have been, whether there were advocates for exclusive worship of one God alone very early on, or whether that view reflects a perspective with hindsight, which assumed that the view they were now convinced was correct must have been revealed earlier and ignored, rather than only revealed late in their history.

Hosea in the 8th century appears to have been a key figure, interpreting the nation's relationship to its God by way of comparison with marital fidelity. Hosea warned that disaster was coming because of non-exclusive worship, and not long after the Northern Kingdom experienced devastation at the hands of the Assyrians. Someone brought Hosea's message south to Judah, and according to 2 Kings, Hezekiah tried implementing centralization of worship and exclusive focus on YHWH, and Jerusalem didn't fall. To ancient people, this would have seemed to be confirmation of Hosea's message, and there seems to have been a strong YHWH-alone party (to use Bernhard Lang's phrase) from that point onward.

Thanks for the answer!

&gt;The only real debate is whether it ought to have been, whether there were advocates for exclusive worship of one God alone very early on, or whether that view reflects a perspective with hindsight, which assumed that the view they were now convinced was correct must have been revealed earlier and ignored, rather than only revealed late in their history.

Do we have any idea how this debate played out? You cited the example of Hosea, but do we have any other examples/records that illustrate what drove Judaism to develop into a monothesistic faith?

&gt;The religion of ancient Israel seems clearly to not have been monotheistic during much of its history - the archaeological evidence and the Biblical texts agree on that.

What did Jewish "polytheism" look like then? Was there a pantheon? What was the relationship of YHWH to other gods/goddesses?
##
The exile, and voices and literature which blamed the exile on failure to worship YHWH alone, seem to have had a key influence in convincing most Jews to embrace exclusive worship.

As for what pre-exilic Israelite polytheism looked like, many of those questions are hard to answer, because the Biblical texts are seeking to wean people off of earlier practices. But archaeology provides some clues, even though they are hard to make sense of without textual commentary. The cult stand from Tanaach which is in the Israel Museum is one that I think is particularly fascinating. It seems to depict YHWH as the sun (and on one level as an empty space), while the other two levels seem to depict Asherah. The inscriptions that we have found mentioning "YHWH and his Asherah" are puzzling, since it is unusual to have a proper name with a possessive construction of this sort. The Jewish temple at Elephantine also provides some evidence relevant to this question of how these traditions persisted in some places even until later times.

There are some relevant sources online - here's one that a quick search found: 
http://www.scribd.com/doc/59784648/8/A-Cult-Stand-from-Tell-Taanach

##
Just adding more on the issue of possessive construction: detailed examination of this issue can be found in Emerton's article "'Yahweh and His Asherah': The Goddess or Her Symbol?," which wonders whether the main inscription that refers to this "refers to the goddess Asherah *or her wooden symbol*." In exploring the possibility of the latter, he cites that

&gt;In the Assyrian example a city *and a temple* bless someone; in the Phoenician example both a god *and an image* are to give a blessing; and in the Aramaic texts someone is remembered for good before deities and also before images

However

&gt;preference for the view that *lyhwh . . . wl'≈°rth* means "by Yahweh .. . and by his asherah" (rather than "... and by his Asherah", i.e. by the goddess directly) is not necessarily dependent on the view that the goddess Asherah was not worshipped in Israel or regarded as the consort of Yahweh. The theory that Asherah is meant is not more straightforward or economical than the hypothesis that the reference is to her symbol.

What roles did women serve in the early church?  Did they serve in the office of the public ministry?  Was there even an 'office of the public ministry' distinct from just being a person who wanted to talk at the gathering?  When did presbyters and elders and bishops and deacons split into different job titles?
##
&gt;What roles did women serve in the early church?

At the very least:

Deaconess (Pliny's to Trajan)

Apostle/messenger (Romans 16:7; cf. Chrysostom to confirm correctness of "Junia")

Host of Church (Acts 16:40)

&gt;When did presbyters and elders and bishops and deacons split into different job titles?

Best guess is pretty early. We see this in Pseudo-Paul (The "Pastoral Epistles,"). Once the apocalypse doesn't happen during the first generation, some law and order needs to be laid down if Christians are going to ride it out long term. This is where we see order for households, hierarchies of authority, and church discipline.
##
Is there a particular English translation of the bible that any of you prefer over the others?
##
I go for the NASB for its literalness - though I've recently come to greatly appreciate the NET Bible, for its extremely insightful notes and the fact that it's not afraid to admit that a verse has become corrupted in the process of transmission, and offer the "original," non-corrupted text based on the consensus of modern scholarship. Scholars are still stuck on the NRSV, though. It's a good translation; but it's also favored for things like its gender neutrality (not necessarily desirable, if your intention is merely the original text, its gender biases and all). 
##
How do you feel about the ESV compared to the NASB? My koine is not anywhere near your expertise, but in the work I've done it seems pretty close to the NASB when it comes to accuracy.
##
I don't know exactly how it happened, but I actually have very little experience with ESV. I've used it maybe 5 times ever. So I can't really comment - sorry. :/

Edit: I love how a comment about how I *can't* comment on the matter gets 13 upvotes.
##
I like nJPS for general-purpose.  Fox for the Torah is cool reading, but not really anything for scholarly purposes.
##
&gt;English

NRSV for OT/NT, NETS for LXX. I don't work much out of translations for Greek stuff though. I've worked very hard to get away from them.
##
Perhaps if I can get the ball rolling...this is especially aimed at /u/ReligionProf, though surely others will have some good stuff to say, too: there's been quite a lot of attention to the Gospel of John and issues of historicity recently (as seen in various ongoing SBL sessions, the edited volumes, etc.). I'm particularly interested in developments of *Christology* here. Not to be too broad, but: what exactly is new with current studies on Johannine Christology, and its place within the emergence of early Christianity (its relationship to Pauline Christology, Synoptics, etc.)?
##
There certainly have been some attempts to see the Gospel of John viewed as a legitimate source for knowledge about the historical figure of Jesus. When it comes to some details about places and chronology, that is certainly a possibility. What is most problematic in the Gospel of John are the words attributed to Jesus, which are in the same style as those attributed to John the Baptist, and those of the narrator, and all different in very striking ways from the other Gospels in the New Testament (James D. G. Dunn, in *The Evidence for Jesus*, provides helpful statistics for differences).

I have often thought that it may be time for a revisiting of the arguments of John A. T. Robinson, who thought that there might indeed be something historical to John and its Christology. He noted that the depiction of Jesus in John need not be read as depicting a divine person striding an inch above the ground, but as a human being with what we might call a sense of mystical union with God, but who nonetheless still views God as "the only true God" (John 17) and himself as the agent of the one God.

There's a lot I could say about this - I wrote my first book on John's Christology and how it relates to earlier texts and traditions, and followed up with another on the relationship between NT Christology and Jewish monotheism. And so let me see if there are follow-up questions that might lead me to focus on specifics!
##
Can you say more about the relationship between John's Jesus, the Synoptics' Jesus and John the Baptist? I remember when I went back and re-read the gospels after several years, my gut reaction (to be perfectly biased) was that the Synoptics contained everything I love about Christianity and John contained everything I can't stand. What would be a good book on the principal differences between the two (theologically, historically, etc.), so that I can talk about this without sounding ignorant and opinionated?
##
This may be an odd question but are you all religious?
##
I'm an Orthodox Rabbi. I affiliate with [Modern Orthodox Judaism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Orthodox_Judaism), especially the *[Torah U'Madda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah_Umadda)* variety which, while being a fairly observant sect of Judaism, believes in a balance of tradition with modernity (or more specifically, that there really isn't a contradistinction between the two necessarily).

If you want to know more about that, I'd recommend reading an article from Prof. Dr. Moshe Bernstein: [The Orthodox Jewish Scholar and Jewish Scholarship](http://www.yutorah.org/_shiurim/TU3_Bernstein.pdf).
##
I'll chime in here. I am; I'm an ordained Presbyterian pastor. As far as my beliefs, I'd be very liberal compared to most Christians in the USA (Southern Baptist/Catholic, but in the so-called "main line," (Episcopals, UCC, etc.) I'd probably best be classed as a moderate. I came to this after I left a brief career in the biological sciences, so I know when I'm speaking with a clear bias and when I'm trying to present a fair case. I value that very much in my work; as KL said, in modern biblical criticism, objectivity is not a joke. You don't submit papers arguing miracles are true or the Holy Spirit did "x" with a text to make it a certain way to professional societies if you want to present.
##
&gt; You don't submit papers arguing miracles are true

Can you elaborate on this? I understand that basing an argument on miracles makes it tough to conclusively prove or disprove anything (since miracles are, by definition, unreliable and tough to verify)--but is it also unfashionable in biblical criticism to *believe* in the miraculous?
##
&gt;but is it also unfashionable in biblical criticism to believe in the miraculous?

No, not at all. Many of the best Jewish and Christian scholars have, as you might expect, a devotional and religious interest in the documents, but that part stays separate from the text critical aspect. In general, any text critical paper or commentary will say little if anything that could not be ascribed to (if the argument is convincing) regardless of religious persuasion. So an exegetical paper on the calming of the storm might look at language, Septuagint connections, connections to Greek epic stories, etc. but it won't ask questions like "how did Jesus do it?" Those are religious questions.
##
I've been a pretty strong atheist for going on 7 or 8 years at this point. 

When it comes to the actual finer, hyper-specialized way that scholarship works, I don't think religious affiliation (or lack thereof) matters that much. I *do* think there are some subtle ways in which religious leanings (or non-religious leanings) might affect views on larger-scale issues. But not so much on smaller-scale issues. /u/TurretOpera nailed it below: 

&gt;any text critical paper or commentary will say little if anything that could not be [sub]scribed to (if the argument is convincing) regardless of religious persuasion. So an exegetical paper on the calming of the storm might look at language, Septuagint connections, connections to Greek epic stories, etc. but it won't ask questions like "how did Jesus do it?"

Besides: the process of academic reception will sort of "weed out" unacceptable arguments anyways.
##
I don't think people normally appreciate how peer review works in the social sciences. The field covers topics that many people feel comfortable spouting off all kinds of unsubstantiated baloney about. If that's the only context you see them discussed then you miss the fantastic ability of historical and psychological research(just to name a few of my favorites) to generate knowledge!
##
I'm a liberal Christian, actively involved in an American Baptist church. Liberal Christians were often among the pioneers in Biblical criticism, and I try to keep true to that noble tradition, allowing the evidence to lead me where it will. 

I agree with koine_lingua that the academy (as a whole) is set up in such a way that, even though we have varying backgrounds that inevitably shape our readings of evidence, the presentation of our conclusions and arguments before our peers means that any biases we have are counterbalanced by the perspectives of others. Obviously there are sectarian institutions and organizations where certain biases clearly dominate. Indeed, the reason they have those sectarian institutions is often precisely to shield students from what most scholars outside of that narrow context think, and the way evidence is allowed to lead to conclusions that are not in keeping with this or that definition of orthodoxy!
##
&gt;I'm a liberal Christian, actively involved in an American Baptist church. Liberal Christians were often among the pioneers in Biblical criticism, and I try to keep true to that noble tradition, allowing the evidence to lead me where it will. 

Could you talk more about the history of biblical criticism and how liberal Christians pioneered this?

Also, how does your work effect how you see the bible and practice Christianity?
##
I'm most familiar with examples from my own field of New Testament, but theologians and scholars like Johannes Weiss, Albert Schweitzer, Rudolph Bultmann etc. reflect an approach that engages in critical study of the evidence and recognizes that the results of such study may challenge traditional beliefs, and should be allowed to do so.

In the Sunday school class I teach, we dig into difficult questions, although I don't inflict every scholarly concern on them! I also recognize that as a scholar and a liberal I wrestle with particular issues and hold particular views, and do not expect that everyone will agree with me.
##
A followup, in particular for those who study the precursors to Judaism: Does having such detailed knowledge about the long slow development and evolution of the religion impact your religious beliefs?

For example, if one approached the field being a relatively mainstream modern jew, I could imagine seeing that the religion used to be significantly different causing them to either change their beliefs to match the older and presumably more "correct" religion, or come to see the religion as arbitrary and become athiest or a follower of a different religion.
##
I'd love to know about:

1. Are there any specific threads we can draw between Zoroastrianism and Ancient Judaism?

2. Can you, at least briefly (I understand if it's difficult), frame the history, development, and eventual spread of Jewish mysticism/Kabbalah?

3. There are interesting theories on how the Pentateuch is an assemblage of at least four writers (or groups of writers) assembling myths. I love Genesis because it best exemplifies this, different accounts of creation, a strange race mating with humans, etc. Do you know if there are specific myths that the Genesis stories in particular are drawn upon, and if the different writers added/edited the stories over time?

4. How did the role of the priest/rabbi evolve after the destruction of the temple and the diaspora occurred? 


Sorry, I have a lot of questions. Raised a Jew, find it interesting. I guess I could go and research... but you're all here! Seems convenient.

Edit: Added question 4 and my apology.
##
&gt;Are there any specific threads we can draw between Zoroastrianism and Ancient Judaism?

This is outside my wheelhouse, but because nobody's answered yet I'll just throw this out there: Yes. Ancient Judaism, as the religion of a small people group, was frequently formulating their theology in reaction to the larger or more powerful nations around them. Many of the stories in the OT, about the Exodus, or about Elijah and the contest with the prophets of Ba'al, or the taking of the Ark of the Covenant to the Temple of Dagon, can be conceptualized as theological arguments that YHWH was bigger and tougher and better than the alternatives from other nations. 

During the exilic period, Judaism seems to have continued the trend to oppose the dualistic beliefs they were encountering in captivity. This is responsible for some passages that have driven conservative theologians up a wall, like:

"I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things." (Isaiah 45:7). 

I believe that some scholars attribute verses like this to encountering theological systems like the one in Zoroastrianism, but if that's off-base, I'm sure another contributor will chime in.

&gt;Do you know if there are specific myths that the Genesis stories in particular are drawn upon

Same caveat as before, but I know that the creation account is heavily dependent on the  En√ªma Elish, and that the subduing of the chaos bears a resemblance to Marduke's slaying of Tiamat and dividing her carcass into parts of the earth.
##
Haha, there was actually an article *just* published in *JHS* that addresses both Gen 1, Isa 45 and the proposed Zoroastrian/ancient Near Eastern connections: Tina Nilsen, "[Creation in Collision? Isaiah 40‚Äì48 and Zoroastrianism, Babylonian Religion and Genesis 1](http://www.jhsonline.org/Articles/article_188.pdf)."
##
Uh oh. Not debunking everything I just said, I hope. I just moved to New Jersey so I haven't had much time to read the last month or so.
##
Sorry, for now, I'm just going to take #1:

&gt; Are there any specific threads we can draw between Zoroastrianism and Ancient Judaism?

I've outlined this in quite a bit of detail on /r/AskHistorians before [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/19by72/wednesday_ama_jewish_history_panel/c8n759a). As you'll see, I believe one of the more significant things is that the development of eschatology in Judaism itself may have been prompted in significant ways by the influx of Zoroastrian (=Iranian) ideas, stemming from the historical interaction of Israel and Iran/Persia (certainly via Babylon).

I've argued that the idea of the cosmic recreation, the "new heavens and new earth" - which becomes a prominent eschatological idea in Christianity (and pre-Christian Judaism) - is probably to be traced back to Zoroastrian/Iranian belief. I'm submitting a paper on this to a major journal soon - so I'll let everyone know if it gets accepted. :P

Also...from Plutarch and Diogenes Laertius, we know that the fourth century BCE Theopompus (of Chios) *already* knows the idea of a Zoroastrian "resurrection."
##
There is a common thought that the New Testament established 'new rules' for the Bible and 'negated' many of the rules of the Old Testament (like animal sacrifice, Deuteronomy, Leviticus, etc.).

I can't find any evidence of this in the Bible.  Is there any truth to this "changing of rules" and if not why is it such a commonly held belief?
##
Paul is notably hostile to the "Law"...though the exact intention of his relationship with it is unclear. But he certainly didn't believe that many of its purity rules applied to Gentiles anymore (despite Gentile Christians still constituting "true Israel").

Outside of Paul, you're inevitably going to come up against things like Matthew 5:17-18, ascribed to Jesus: "until heaven and earth pass away, not one iota or stroke shall pass from the Law, until everything comes to pass"? These are also very problematic verses. I've discussed them in some detail [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1k9bg7/lets_talk_about_matthew_518/cbmrjqu).

Further, you're going to come up against sayings ascribed to Jesus himself, like "The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath." Quoting Crossley,

&gt;Despite a variety of scholarly conclusions, it is widely accepted that [the earliest gospel] Mark's portrayal of Jesus in some way shows him breaking, challenging or ignoring certain biblical laws, particularly, but not exclusively, those that involve purity.

Crossley would be representative of a minority of scholars who take a sort of "maximalist" approach to the degree of Jesus' alignment with traditional Law:

&gt;in stark contrast to modern scholarship, it will be shown that Mark portrays Jesus *always* as one observant of biblical laws 

(though the issue of how to define "observant of" would seem to be a factor here)
##
You can find an account of the council that determined this in the 15th chapter of Acts.  Paul also provides an account in Galatians.  
##
There was a post on this just yesterday - I wrote a pretty long response [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1s6e4b/whats_the_theological_reasoning_for_why/cdugpjf).

Excellent, thanks!  I remember that thread yesterday where I gave a similarly pithy response that was utterly dwarfed by your substantive contribution.  jeez, what are you, some sort of expert?
##
What can you tell us about pre-Nicean Christianity?

I'm curious if there is any legitimacy to Orthodox Christianity holding the 'true' beliefs or if they just 'won out', so to speak. I'm sure theres a lot to go into, but could you highlight some of the differing beliefs of the first 300 years, how certain beliefs were decided as 'heretical' pre-council, and by what measure were things decided as true beliefs.

If you'd like to speak on what happened at the Council of Nicea and the events leading up to it I would love to read that as well.
##
Over in my field, there's generally a lot of reluctance to consider the possibility that a Greco-Roman writer (prior to, say, the 3rd century CE) might be aware of, or play on, Jewish or Christian writings. When they see an apparent connection, instead of direct reference they'll almost always argue that both texts come from a hypothetical lost archetype, or a traditional trope, instead. What's the perspective from your side?

To take one example: Lucian's description of the city of the blessed in *True Histories* 2.25-26 looks to me to be obviously a parody of John's heavenly Jerusalem in *Revelation* 21. The scholarship on this is sparse, but the majority view -- though not the most recent one -- is that there's no connection: Lucian's just playing with a traditional thing. (I'm happy to supply *many* more details if you really want.) Much earlier, there have been books coming out on Homer recently by Bruce Louden that argue (very, very implausibly IMO) that both the Homeric epics play extensively on early Jewish texts, in particular *Genesis*.

So... what do you make of cases like these? Are there other cases that you could suggest?
##
Hey man! This is a fantastic question. 

&gt;When they see an apparent connection, instead of direct reference they'll almost always argue that both texts come from a hypothetical lost archetype, or a traditional trope, instead

I'm sure you might be aware of my answer to ["Is it possible that Virgil's fourth Eclogue is evidence that he relied on the Biblical book of Isaiah?"](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1nto4n/in_a_footnote_to_my_copy_of_the_eclogues_the/ccm07p1) (and also perhaps my post [speculating about how Revelation may in fact draw on some other lost hybrid Indo-European eschatological source](http://www.reddit.com/r/AncientWorld/comments/1lkowc/the_titanomachy_indoeuropean_eschatology_and_the/)).

As for the heavenly Jerusalem and Lucian, I'm absolutely certain that some good info could be found in the recent monograph [*Revelation 21-22 in Light of Jewish and Greco-Roman Utopianism*](http://www.brill.com/revelation-21-22-light-jewish-and-greco-roman-utopianism). I own this - so I'd be happy to look into this further and follow up.

Ugh, this is a great topic...wish I had more time to get into it (there are so. many. questions to get to). Please post something about this on /r/AcademicBiblical - I'd love to get back to this more.
##
Since Christmas is approaching, what is the historicity of the Nativity?  
##
The mainstream consensus of critical scholarship are that the Nativity narratives of Matthew and Luke are late and fictive stories created to get Jesus born in Bethlehem. There are a number of historical problems (impossibilities really) with both stories, and the stories are mutually contradictory with each other.
##
Can you elaborate on the inconsistencies/impossibilities?
##
Well to start with, the stories are set ten years apart. Matthew has Jesus being born during the reign of Herod the Great and Luke has him born during the census of Quirinius. Herod died in 4BCE the census of Quirinus took place in 6-7 CE. No Roman census ever required anyone to travel to their ancestral homes. The census of Quirinius applied only to Judea and not Galilee, so Joseph would not have been subject to it up in Nazareth. 

The slaughter of the innocents by Herod is uncorroborated anywhere outside the Gospel of Matthew, including by Josephus who goes into great detail about the atrocities of Herod, but never mentions this. 

According to the Israeli Antiquities Authority, Bethlehem was not even inhabited during the 1st Century. 

If you read Matthew and Luke side by side, you will see that they are completely different stories with little overlap and numerous contradictions. Their genealogies are different, Matthew has the family living in a house in Bethlehem from the beginning, then fleeing to Egyot, then relocating to Galilee to avoid Archelaus in Judea. Luke has them starting off in Nazareth, going to Bethlehem for the census, then (after dedicating Jesus at the Temple) returning directly to Nazareth with no flight to Egypt (and no mention of a slaughter of innocents).

That's a few of the major problems.
##
Thank you. That is what I understood. 

Why was it so important that Jesus be born in Bethlehem? If they were ficitive stories, is it likely that they just created by individuals or was there some kind of group reasoning involved (i.e. was there a group that felt it necessary to create them)? When are they thought to date from? 
##
The significance of Bethlehem is that it was the birthplace of David. It was expected (and prophesied) that the Davidic heir would be born in the same city as David.
##
Can you comment on these impossibilities more?
##
When the bible is translated to speak of "Witches" what Greek or Hebrew root word are we translating from and who were the "witches" the writers were referencing? 
##
One word in Hebrew would be derive from the verb ◊õ÷º÷∏◊©÷∑◊Å◊£ (*kashaf*) - "to practice witchcraft." It's used to refer to the "magicians" of Egypt in the Exodus narrative; there's also ◊ß÷∂◊°÷∂◊ù, "divination, witchcraft." People who engage in this are the subject of highly critical language (and legislation) in Deuteronomy and elsewhere.

In Greek, œÜŒ±œÅŒºŒ±Œ∫Œµ·ΩªœÇ is used: *pharmakeus* - though this word has a broad range of meanings.

Establishing the exact semantic range of some of these words is difficult. There's a lot of overlap. From its use in conjunction with prostitution, ◊ó◊ë◊® means ‚Äúcharm‚Äù - that is, something used to seduce or hypnotize someone (esp. so as to gain romantic/erotic affections). ◊ó◊®◊ò◊ù, used in reference to the Egyptian magicians of Exodus, is probably an Egyptian loanword meaning something like 'priest who recites (magical) scrolls'. The use of œÜŒ±œÅŒºŒ±Œ∫ŒµŒØŒ± (*pharmakeia*) for ◊ú◊î◊ò◊ô◊ù ('fiery ones'?) in the Greek translation of Ps. 57.4 may come from a misunderstanding of ◊ú(◊î)◊ò as 'enchantment'.
##
&gt; pharmakeus

Connection between this and "pharmacist/pharmaceutical" is a good one for the uninitiated. These were people who mixed up Pharmakon, potions, spells, amulets, etc. For an epic story about Pharmakon "in the bible," read Tobit.
##
Thanks for taking the time to educate us today!

My question is rooted in food customs. I'm a professional cook and I have had to modify food many times for religious customers. I always find myself curious about the true practical origins of food restrictions within religions. 

To be specific I'd really like to know the "non mythical" reasons, those that have nothing to do with the religious dogma. For instance my family is catholic (I am not) and my mother who hates fish always mentioned that the reason you weren't allowed to eat meat on friday was because the church had a deal with the fish markets who were struggling financially an would benefit from the churches restriction. There's of course a religious justification for why you can't eat meat, but there was a *real* reason behind it and that's what I'm looking for. 

Specifically the restriction of shellfish, pork, not mixing dairy and meat, are things I'm curious about. People who are keeping kosher always have interesting restrictions (though I'm aware strict kosher requires things that can't be found in an ordinary kitchen) Along with the catholic no mean on friday myth that I'm not sure is entirely true.

Feel free to add in along with the real conditions the religious justification for said conditions and if food restrictions have changed over the years to reflect modern taste.

Thanks again for any answers you all may provide.  
##
&gt;Specifically the restriction of shellfish, pork, not mixing dairy and meat, are things I'm curious about.

There's no documented reason why these customs would've been instituted.  There are some hypotheses that they were to prevent disease, but they're not terribly well-supported.

&gt;if food restrictions have changed over the years to reflect modern taste.

Not a ton--the whole point of the restrictions was to restrict, so the only main changes to reflect modernity is people no longer keeping them.  Small changes, such as development of a named category that was neither meat nor dairy (which was theoretically possible before, but no one actually did it) occurred, along with the adaptation to new culinary developments, such as turkey, corn, etc.
##
Has anyone of you changed your religious affiliations because of your intense studies? 
##
I went from being a conservative Christian to a liberal one.
##
This is really outside the scope of the panel, but kind of. I started life as a Barthian universalist. I've abandoned the position since going to seminary, even though the seminary was very heavily Barthian Universalist as well.
##
I was in the midst of abandoning my evangelical views and adopting more progressive/liberal views when I began my studies. My dissatisfaction with fundamentalist Christianity made me open to seeing what the Biblical texts really said, and there was a feedback loop as the things I learned made me more liberal and more open to Biblical scholarship ‚Äî and just as importantly, less dogmatic and more tolerant of diverse viewpoints.

Today, I see the Bible as a thoroughly human creation, but a fascinating one that records centuries of ideas, arguments, riddles and mysteries.
##
I've only become more secure in my atheism. :P
##
What are some of the major translation disagreements from early or original religious texts? 
##
I may be a little biased - because my major recent paper centered on this - but the last line of Psalm 22:16 (22:17 in some numbering systems) is a notoriously difficult text...certainly one of the top 5 most hotly debated ones in the entire Bible. Traditional Christian renderings (KJV, NIV, NASB) have "They have pierced my hands and my feet," as if it's prophetic of the crucifixion of Jesus. Other renderings have "My hands and my feet *have shriveled*" (NRSV). The Jewish Publication Society Bible translates the Hebrew text literally, "*Like a lion* [at] my hands and my feet." Other scholars suggest something "they *bound* my hands and my feet." 

The problem is that Hebrew manuscripts have different readings. They all hinge basically on *one letter*: whether the Hebrew word is ◊õ◊ê◊®◊ï (a verb - from a root like "to bind" or "to shrivel" or "to dig") or ◊õ◊ê◊®◊ô ("like" + "lion," like the JPS translation).

All of these proposals are extremely problematic.

Did Jews believe in demons during the second temple period and if so where did that belief originate? I know that Jews don't believe in the devil in the way that Christians do but there seem to be Jewish references to demons in the New Testament.
##
&gt;Did Jews believe in demons during the second temple period

Absolutely. This belief has its origins in deep ancient Near Eastern antiquity - and in fact some of the more "traditional" Jewish names of demons are originally Mesopotamian demons.

There was, however, an etiology for evil spirits that was a little more idiosyncratic in the Judaism(s) of the time leading up to the Common Era. This can be found in the book of Enoch (and elsewhere), and traced the origin of these spirits to the deceased offspring of the [Nephilim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim‚Äé). Early Christianity *definitely* was aware of this motif, and ran with it.

I want to lift this up especially. If you're not familiar with this discipline and care at all, the Enochic literature are the most fascinating books you've never heard of. Not only do we see in them the demonology that underlies Tobit, but we get a etiological story about where these demons come from: The Nephilim, giant half-demons, were the cause of the flood (God wanted to exterminate them). However, their demon half wasn't mortal (obviously), and continued to roam the world. This is why demons are always possessing people-they are trying to get back into their moral bodies, back into a living host.
##
Haha, yeah! I've been really excited about the increased attention to the Enochic literature in the past decade or so. In tandem with the insights we've gleaned from the DSS, I'd say this may be one of the most significant breakthroughs in understanding early Christianity that we've had.

Have you read Reza Aslan's latest book, Zealot? If so, do you agree or disagree with the information as he presents it?

I wrote a review - or, really, *two* reviews - previously on /r/AskHistorians...and they can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1j9jm4/what_does_raskhistorians_think_of_reza_aslan_and/cbcjfhq).

I always wondered how much information exists on the traditions of the ancient Jews, before the Mishnah was redacted. Is it similar to today‚Äôs traditions? Did different traditions exist simultaneously (like between the Israeli kingdom and the kingdom of Judah)? Can notable shifts be seen between different traditions? Are the dead-sea scrolls exceptional, or were there other similar communities/scripts?
##
The question is kinda too broad to really be able to tackle in detail. Not exactly sure how you're delineating the term "tradition." Since it's so broad, I'm just going to go ahead and pick out one thing that may apply: you may be interested in the line of thought that's been explored by scholars like Konrad Schmid and others (see his recent *Genesis and the Moses Story: Israel's Dual Origins in the Hebrew Bible*). The title should say a lot in-and-of-itself: that the traditions of the *patriarchs in Genesis* and the tradition of *Moses leading "Israel" out of Egypt* were only *secondarily* joined - originally autonomous "origin stories" for Israel (to oversimplify).

There was also quite a bit of "sectarianism" in Judaism in the last couple of centuries leading up to the Common Era (and beyond). The Qumran "community" (who preserved/composed various things among the Dead Sea Scrolls) certainly was a breakaway sect that believed the traditional Temple/Priestly leadership to be corrupt.
##
Can any of you comment on the role of women in the early Christian church?  I'm particularly curious about what roles, if any, they played in Church leadership.
##
It seems that the very early church was egalitarian, perhaps radically so. The Gospels portray wealthy women (like Mary Magdalene) as having been the financial patrons of Jesus and his followers. Some women feature prominently in Paul's letters, like Phoebe and the female apostle Junia. In *The Acts of Paul and Thecla*, a second-century hagiographic work on the apostle Paul, he was accompanied by a chaste female companion named Thecla. Whether historically accurate or not (probably not), it shows that the earliest Christians saw little problem with female leaders, especially in association with celibacy (even among married women, as couples were encouraged to live as "brother and sister").

Feminism was also a notable aspect of Gnostic Christianity ‚Äî which, far from being a fringe movement, was a widespread part of the early church.

By the end of the second century, however, we already see the tendency to make the church conform to the patriarchic expectations of the broader culture. (This is particularly evident in the Pastoral epistles, for example.)
##
Within religious studies, there's been a lot of criticism of religious interests dominating the objective, academic, dare I say "scientific" study of religion (Donald Wiebe's *The Politics of Religious Studies*, Tim Fitzgerald's *The Ideology of Religious Studies*, Russell McCutcheon's *Manufacturing Religion*, etc.).  Do you see contemporary theology as impinging on current historical work?
##
What do historians actually think Jesus was doing, in terms of healing people? Is there any evidence for him actually healing the blind and the sick? What type of healing must he have been doing for him to gain a following?
##
Curiously enough, I know a lot of biblical scholars who think the healings and miracles were an authentic part of Jesus' ministry; not that he *could* do them, but that people were drawn to him because they *thought he could.* There are thousands of modern examples of people like this today, especially if you go to African nations like Kenya, where a speaker will heal someone and they'll genuinely feel that they're healed from X. What's going on there is either a psychological or religious question, one is beyond the scope of my expertise, the other of this panel.
##
Is there anything about early Christianity that would seem heretical to modern Christians?
##
Okay, I only asked questions a few minutes ago, but I just noticed /u/koine_lingua is an expert on eschatology so:

I've often heard early Christianity characterised by an obsession with "the end of the world". Is this fair?

Also, can you recommend any books on beliefs about eschatology in the early church (or hell, any books about the theology of the early church).
##
Ugh...I wrote a detailed reply near the beginning of the AMA, but then accidentally exited out. Will you forgive me if I link to [another comment in which I addressed the earliest eschatological expectations at length](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1pjt7a/how_much_fallibility_are_you_willing_to_accept/cd32j0j)?

Baiscally, *yes* - eschatological fervor was quite common in the time around the birth of Christianity; and "early Christianity" certainly capitalized on it, and even brought it to new heights. I mention this is the comment I linked to, but I always thought that the end of the 4th chapter of Paul's epistle to the Thessalonians encapsulates just how serious eschatological conviction had become for early Christians: the Thessalonians seem to be struggling with the fact that some of them have died - and how this might fit into the eschatological scheme. In his answer, Paul imagines those who remain on earth *simply as a "remnant."*
##
I've heard that the acting party in Genesis 1 was "Elohim" which is plural and is in reference to the Caananite pantheon, while Genesis 2 was Yahweh which might be the Caananite war god.  Is this accurate?  If so, can you expand on this?  If not, can you at least clarify this?
##
&gt; I've heard that the acting party in Genesis 1 was "Elohim" which is plural 

Well, not just that, but on several occasions he speaks *using* first-person plurals: "Let *us* [do this]." Several other texts have God as a member of the so-called "divine council" (especially some poetic material, like in the Psalms) - though he appears as *head* of this council.

Yes, there are different names used in Gen 1 and Gen 2. The exact origins of this deity (and his name) are hotly contested. I'll try to get back to this with some more info soon.
##
What do you believe is the defining characteristic of Judaism that distinguished it from other monotheistic religions that came before it?

Why did Judaism and it's derivative religions (Christianity and Islam) become so successful? 
##
I believe the uniqueness of Judaism is something of a misconception. All the major civilizations underwent a transition in their conception of religion during the [Axial Age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_Age), and we could say that each religion was unique in its own way. At the same time, each religion, Judaism included, existed as a continuum of beliefs influenced through contact with other cultures.

Perhaps the most notable aspect of Judaism in comparison with Christianity, Islam, Zoroastrianism, and other major religions was that it managed to maintain its identity as an ethnic signifier. Jewishness is both a religious and an ethnic identity, and its prescriptions do not apply outside that ethnic group ‚Äî unlike other religions that were widespread at the turn of the era, like Zoroastrianism, Mithraism, the Osiris cult, the Attis cult, etc. Many of the Jewish scriptures, obviously, promote Yahweh as the Jews' only God and the Jews as Yahweh's only people, though there are texts that dissent from this point of view.

In fact, one might say that Christianity exists because there were Greeks and other non-Jews who wanted to participate in the Jewish religion without adopting Jewish cultural practices and rules. 
##
What do you think is the main message of the Book of Job?
Do you think that the monologues of Elihu are authentic or not?
##
It's something that sounds insane to us. The thesis of the book is that there is not a 1-1 correlation between how great your life is and how much God loves you, or between having a crappy life and doing something wrong. 

The reason why people are gobsmacked when Jesus says that it's hard for rich people to be saved is because it seems that conventional wisdom was that if you were rich had a ton of kids and one or more hot wives, that God loved you. If you were poor, a slave, barren (cf. every narrative about barrenness in the whole OT) or diseased, God hated you. Job sets out to tell a story where an omniscient narrator allows that theory to be put to rest.

As to Elihu, no. The author of that monologue completely misses the point.
##
Are there direct descendants of the House of David today?

##
What topics are "hot" in today's biblical criticism and analysis?
##
In the realm of historical criticism, the study of memory is a growing focus.  Psychology of memory is problematizing many of the assumptions that positivist historians used to work with, which were often expressed in terms of it being possible to decisively separate "facts" from the ideologically-driven interpretation thereof. As James Dunn emphasized in a recent book on the subject, we cannot get back beyond the remembered Jesus to a Jesus that no one had interpreted as of religious significance. Anthony Le Donne has done some important work on the methodological aspects of this. 
 
##
Is there any evidence to prove that pre-niceaen Christianity and post-niceaen Christianity are anything alike? What sources do we have that validate that the New Testament is not a forgery? 
##
We actually have New Testament manuscripts from before the time of the Council of Nicaea. We also have other Christian writings which genuinely seem to have been composed prior to Nicaea, since they do not mesh naturally with the views that were defined as orthodox at Nicaea - and indeed, the debates did not end with Nicaea by any means!

The conspiracy theory view of Christian origins is popular in certain circles, but it simply doesn't fit the evidence which depicts a much messier historical development in Christianity.
##
Some of my favorite books in the Hebrew Bible are also some of the weirder ones--Ecclesiastes, Amos, Hosea.  How would these books, minor prophets and non-Psalmic "Writings" (Ketuvim), have been used 1) before the destruction of the Temple, and 2) in the first few centuries after the destruction of the Temple (by both Christians and Jews)?
##
Catholic and Orthodox Christians draw their authority from the belief they are the apostolic descendants of the 12 apostles. Is there any evidence to show which apostles went where beyond the traditions of each sect? For example,  the Coptic Orthodox Christians consider themselves descended from St. Mark, and both the Catholic and Greek Orthodox of Antioch Churches claim decent from St. Peter. Is this idea of apostolic succession a principle generally agreed upon by the early Christians? 

Relatedly, a lot of churches teach a very unified Christian identity until the Protestant reformation. How accurate is this in the time immediately following Christ's death? I have a very hard time imagining, with all the traveling Jesus and his apostles did, that a single unified early Christian sect was a reality. 

Please and thanks
##
Currently taking a very interesting class on Early Christian Mysticism/ Asceticism in the Patristic Era, and I was wondering if any of you guys could answer a question for me. When did the tradition of Christian monasticism begin, and what were its major influences? Were there any Judaic influences? Or were there Judaic hermits/monkish figures that would have provided inspiration?

Thanks for doing this! Very interested to see the results. 
##
The origins of Christian monasticism are generally traced back to a Hermit in the Egyptian deserts called Anthony of Alexandria, but in a weird way. Anthony was pretty rich (family fortune) but one day decided to sell it all and live an ascetic life. He put his sister in a convent and sold all their positions (probably without consulting her), and  gave the money away. Then he went to live in a hole in the ground and battle the temptations of the world. He probably was definitely not the first Christian to do this. As other cults, like Manicheanism, should make abundantly clear, the "meme" of stoicism and gratuitous self denial as a path to enlightenment was already going strong, particularly in North Africa, during the time of Christ.

In what was becoming a common theme in Christianity, it wasn't until someone else decided to write a book about St Anthony that his ideas, or at least his ideas as conceptualized by Athanasius of Alexandria, "went viral." Latin translations of this work helped to spur on the age of high monasticism in Europe, epitomized by the great monasteries, like Cluny in France.

As for the actual, true origin of Monasticism/Asceticism in Jewish or quasi-Jewish sects, nobody really knows. It was around before Jesus for sure (Essens, John the Baptist), and almost certainly before that.
##
1.  Do you think that the Gospels are authentic(written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, John)?

2.  When would you date the Gospels?

3.  Do you think the Gospels are reliable? (meaning what we read today in the Greek manuscripts is accurate to what was originally written)
##
The truth is that we simply don't know what the names of the Gospel authors were. The traditions should not be simply dismissed, nor simply accepted. In the case of Mark, it is hard for me to think of a good reason why an attribution to someone who wasn't an apostle was invented. And so that attribution has a higher degree of plausibility than the Gospel of Matthew's.

You can actually consult a Greek New Testament with critical apparatus, and get a sense of what sorts of variations there are across the existing manuscripts. It isn't the case that they were copied perfectly, but it also isn't the case that they become completely unrecognizable different works. They were copied imperfectly and so are much like other ancient texts that we have.
##
How did Christian mysticism manifest itself in the early days of Christianity? Who are some of the early mystics and how did their practices differ from "mainline" (I use that term loosely, of course) Christianity?
##
One problem is how "mysticism" itself is to be defined. An argument could be made that the idea of Jesus' equality with God (which the Gospel of John has Jesus himself claiming on several occasions) is *itself* a "mystical" idea. When people ask about this issue, I often refer to a text that was found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, usually referred to as the "Self-Glorification Hymn":

&gt;[‚Ä¶No]ne can compare [to] my glory; none has been exalted save myself, and none can oppose me. I sit in [‚Ä¶ hea]ven, and none [su]rround (me). I am reckoned with the divine beings, my habitation is in the holy congregation. [My]desi[re] is not according to flesh, [rather] my [por]tion lies in the glory of the holy [dwel]ling.

It's not entirely clear who's speaking here...but it's certainly insightful as to what sort of claims were being made (or were *imagined* to have been made) in the wider Jewish world - which obviously also elucidates early Christianity.

(I'm going to try to get back to this question in a bit, and edit in some more stuff)

do scholars like yourselves consider the book of mormon to be acurate true history? Everybody within he mormon church loves to say how "even non-mormon scholars accept the book of mormon as truth"
##
This is never very popular with the LDS - and if you're Mormon and this offends you, I apologize in advance - but scholars like myself view the *Book of Mormon* and other early Mormon texts as modern forgeries with [absolutely no relationship to history as we know it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Abraham#Incorrect_reconstruction_of_lacunae).
##
I'm formerly Mormon, and I'm curious to know if you see any parallels between the evolution of Mormon scriptures and Jewish/Christian scriptures.  That is, do you think that Joseph Smith's methods for adding to and expanding scripture resemble the way that Old and New Testament authors added to and expanded scripture?  Do you see him as doing the same thing that ancient authors did, or was he acting in a completely different way?

I ask because I've read a couple of books by Bart Ehrman, and I keep seeing similarities between Smith and ancient authors who -- in Ehrman's term -- "forged" new scriptures to accommodate their situations and beliefs.  I just can't tell if I'm seeing the similarities because they are real or just because of my personal history.
##
I apologize if this question seems especially simple, but a couple of my friends argue about this every time we get together, but would the wine that Jesus and his disciples drink throughout the New Testament be fermented and what proof is there either way? 
##
The fact that they refer to it as wine, with no qualification, makes it quite clear. It is only because some Christians in the present day oppose all consumption of alcohol that there have been creative attempts to try to make it all unfermented grape juice.

I actually wrote a chapter on this, "'A Glutton and a Drunkard'? What Would Jesus Drink?" in the book *Religion and Alcohol: Sobering Thoughts* edited by C. K. Robertson. 
##
Yes it was.  Luke 5:36-39 would not make sense otherwise (only fermenting wine would burst old wineskins).

I've heard a rabbi say that the traditions of the orthodox Judaism has been preserved so well that if a modern person were to transport 2000 years back and walk into a synagogue, everything would look pretty much the same: the structure and length of the service, the clothing people wear, etc...

Can this be true?
##
I am an Orthodox Rabbi as well. The answer here is no, no and no. Orthodox Judaism preserves an awful lot, but it is a flexible system not designed to keep everything exactly the same (just keep the same ideas). There would be a lot of activities which we would recognize, heck we'd be better off at relating on numerous issues than for other people thrust two thousand years back (and we'd have the same language for the most part), but there are many other things which we would not.

&gt;the structure and length of the service

The barebones structure would be there. The concepts of prayer such as the amidah we know went back that far as we can show from various sources. However, the prayer services have been greatly expanded, and you would not find any pesukei dezimra, kabbalat shabbat or aleinu prayers being recited (largely medieval innovations).

&gt;the clothing people wear

[This](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VES_s4cV6YY/SwthQ2bLEHI/AAAAAAAAACA/GtamGXk1bBo/s1600/DuraSyn-III-Jeremiah.jpg) is what Jews wore 2000 years ago. Without the Tzitzi, he basically would look just like a Roman. There's no such thing as Jewish clothing, we just wear whatever everyone else wears, and then we keep wearing it long after they stop wearing it (e.g. four cornered garments such as the Toga with tzitzit becomes the tallit gadol over time when we stop wearing four cornered garments).

Was the Sumerian goddess Asherah actually believed to be the wife of the Hebrew YHWH/Jehovah and worshiped as such? To continue, would this be religious syncretism of Levant cultures or something more along the lines of the Aeon/syzygy in gnosticism?
##
Asherah was probably a part of Israelite worship since time immemorial and not a borrowing from others through syncretistic processes. The Israel Museum in Jerusalem is full of archaeological evidence that exclusive worship of YHWH alone was not the norm until significantly later.

What was the ancient/early church's position on homosexuality, and how has it changed in the two millenniums since?

Similarly, how did it compare to the attitudes of other contemporary religions and philosophies? (For example, the Greeks are fairly well-known to have social codes supporting pederasty.)
##
&gt;What was the ancient/early church's position on homosexuality, and how has it changed in the two millenniums since?

Coming out of the Jewish tradition's potent aversion to homosexual sex (there was no such thing as a sexual orientation back then, sex was something you "did," not something you had) practices, most scholars think that Paul's intent was to place a blanket ban on anything that tended that way. It's unknown what Jesus would have thought; in Jewish territories outing yourself would have meant ostricism or death, so Jesus never encounters a gay person or speaks about it. I don't think Paul dwells on it very much, in part because most converts would have likely been Gentile "god-fearers," Gentiles interested in and practicing some of the tenets of Judaism, before they became Christians. As such, it's pretty unlikely that 

&gt;how did it compare to the attitudes of other contemporary religions and philosophies? (For example, the Greeks are fairly well-known to have social codes supporting pederasty.

Gay sex was actually on the outs with a lot of the philosophies that influenced Christianity in the 1st Century, like stoicism and asceticism. Again, there was no "homosexual," orientation, rather, homosexuality was often characterized as an excess of sexual passion-you were so full of the desire for sex, that you'd have sex with another person of your sex. Many other religions featured homosexual sex or prostitution in conjunction with their temple cult. Many scholars think that that's probably part of the reason why Paul comes down so hard on it; Christianity is supposed to be a clean break from "paganism" and polytheism.
##
I hear a lot of people who believe in Jesus Christ, but not Christianity or any specific religion. Have you heard of people like this and what is your opinion on it? 
##
To me, it doesn't make any sense (and unlike some of our other contributors, I'm a self-professed Christian). We don't have a Gospel of Jesus; everything we know (or think we know) about him comes from the authors of Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and a little snippet from Paul. That's it. To think that you can somehow "get behind" the stuff that Jesus' followers have built and access Jesus in some pretended "pure" form is misguided. If you strip away the religion, in the process, you strip away virtually everything else. What you're left with is that there was probably a man Jesus, he probably taught some stuff, and he probably was executed. Probably.

Great panal, you're all brilliant. It's a hoot to see one of my favorite bible bloggers, Mr. Exploring Our Matrix himself, posting!

Here is what could be considered a softball question, but I think it has significance for Christian biblical interpretation. 

Outside of theologically exegeting the text, is there a way to mesh matthian understandings of salvation with Pauline?

Excellent! So glad to see other people interested. If you'll excuse me, I'm just going to "retool" a previous answer I gave to someone about this.

You've probably heard all the cliched nuggets of advice before...but the most important ones are this: make sure you're *crazy* about doing research in this area. I'd say that the people who do the best work in the field are borderline obsessed with it. They're certainly not just hobbyists. :P

I'd say the only other important thing, besides having an insane passion for it, is to be *good* at it. Of course, being 'good' comes from 1) having some sort of natural ability, and 2) a hell of a lot of 'practice'/study. There are the obvious ways to start out: reading introductory textbooks, etc. Though I can't emphasize enough just how valuable it is to jump into the highest levels of research as quickly as possible - mainly reading articles in the top journals, etc. Even if you might struggle with some of this material at first, it's extremely valuable, to see how things are "really done." Also, this way you'll know what you're up against, and you won't accept mediocrity from yourself.

Finally - and this is almost as important as the others - *be extremely ambitious*. Don't be afraid to throw around very adventurous ideas. Of course, though, *test all these ideas against the most rigorous standards of critical thought that you can muster*.

I casually entertain about 10 crazy ideas a day. Even if you end up discarding 9 of them, you might still end up with 1 wild, brilliant idea that's going to be extremely valuable.

What are your thoughts on the short ending of Mark? It seems it may not be a resurrection account at all, something more like the trope of the hero "never being seen again," as if he were just brought up to heaven like Enoch or Elijah.

Also, where do you think the idea of the resurrection came from if it never happened? Could it have originally meant that Jesus shed his mortal body and was resurrected as an angelic being serving god in heaven, like in the stories of Enoch or Melchizedek? Do you think there's any influence from the idea in one of the Books of the Maccabees that a noble martyr could appear before god as an intercessor for his people?

This is exciting! I have a few questions:

1. How did Judaism become monotheistic, and did it become monotheistic as the Torah was being written, or before, or after?

2. Was Judaism unique in its monotheism? If yes (and if no also), what about the Israelites made them "susceptible" to being monotheistic? Did the idea of monotheism just happen to develop, or was it a result of cultural practices, traditions, or environmental factors, etc.?

3. Was Christianity always monotheistic? And how did the idea of the Trinity develop with monotheism?

4. Is there a specific point in time where we can say Christianity became a distinct religion?
##
&gt; How did Judaism become monotheistic, and did it become monotheistic as the Torah was being written, or before, or after?

During. The Torah preserves many polytheistic traditions. One of the most obvious is that older versions of Deuteronomy 32 contain a poem about El the most high God dividing the nations among his sons and giving Israel to Yahweh.

Second Isaiah (Isaiah chapters 40-55) is generally regarded as the earliest part of the Old Testament to make unambiguously monotheistic statements.

&gt; Was Judaism unique in its monotheism? 

Not as much as is often thought. During the [Axial Age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_Age), most major religions were moving toward monotheistic conceptions of divinity. Judaism itself seems to have become monotheistic while under the rule of the Persian empire, whose state religion of Zoroastrianism was basically monotheistic and quite influential on Judaism. One God, a devil, named archangels, and the resurrection of the righteous are all concepts that probably originated with Zoroastrianism. 

&gt; Was Christianity always monotheistic? 

No; many sects believed that God the Father was a different being from the creator God of the Jews. Gnostic sects in particular believed in many divine beings, including Sophia, the personification of Wisdom.

&gt; Is there a specific point in time where we can say Christianity became a distinct religion?

That one, I'm not totally sure about. There were several Jewish Christian sects that we know little about, like the Ebionites and the Nazarenes. (In fact, the Koran may preserve knowledge about them.)
##
Wow, I've been looking forward to this all week. Thanks a bunch in advance!

Can you talk about early Christian prayer circles? Who participated in them? Where did they take place? What was their purpose?

Did the temple in Jerusalem play any role in ancient Christianity following Christ's death?


##
Are any of you familiar with The Corpus Hermeticum? Do you think this book influenced the bible/Christianity/Judaism?
##
I have a few questions:

Excavations from synagogues all throughout the Palestine suggest that there was a large amount of syncretism between Hellenistic religions and Judaism well into late antiquity. I'm thinking particularly of the [Hamat Tiberias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamat_Tiberias) mosaic which depicts a zodiac with Helios at the centre. I wonder if this may offer a more complex portrait of ancient Judaism than is generally known of by the general public given that Tiberias was the seat of the Sanhedrin while this synagogue was in use. 

Also, does the fact that biblical higher criticism developed out of the Romanticist and Idealist traditions during the nineteenth century obscure any of the assumptions behind Source Criticism or any other historical criticism for you? As far as I'm aware the Romantic tradition gave rise to German volkish nationalism as well as higher criticism; the history of Israel projects which were developed following de Wette and others appears to idealise a pristine/pure original Hebraismus which appears very similar to the esteemed moral religion of the liberal Protestants which subsequently degenerated into an evil ritualised Judaismus. Given the anti-Semitism and anti-Catholicism behind much of these histories does a critical hermeneutic not demand that scholars take German higher criticism and its effects with a grain of salt? 

Also, concerning an early high Christology, if the assumptions behind German higher criticism are reconsidered, would it not make sense that earliest Christianity may not have been the simple, peasant religion that many contemporary scholars consider it to have been, (especially those in the more liberal camp like Crossan and Borg)? If the assumption that that which is most mythological must be latest because mythology must be viewed of as degenerate is abandoned, then would it not stand to reason that earliest Christianity may have harboured a considerable amount of mythology? Jesus himself may have even believed that he was a divine figure or the incarnation of Yhwh? He may even have believed that his death was the outpouring of Yhwh's blood and he may have seen it as an Eschatological/Soteriological event, no? 

Lastly, I'm curious as to whether you consider the biblical canon to be closed? If you do, how do you decide who closed it? My understanding is that there has never been a unified ecclesiological pronouncement on the issue, especially if one harbours more ecumenical concerns. What do you think about early canonical debates? This may be a very broad question but would you consider it important if the Muratorian fragment were given a later date as some have argued? Would you consider it important if Constantine be understood of as offering the idea of a standard and consistent canon rather than the reality of one (certainly there are considerable variations even after him)? What do you make of the variations which continued to exist long into the Medieval period or that it took the invention of printing technology to offer the reality of a standardised and internally consistent copy of a text? Or that canonical debates continued long into the Reformation? I'm just curious if this is given much thought in academia today and whether it nuances ones take on the Bible eo ipso.

In the case of Central America, the integration of the Spanish language came about primarily through a process called "Mestizaje". When coffee plantations spread and subsumed nearby indigenous lands, the indigenous communities soon became an integral part of the workforce and over time, they began to slowly forget their language through each generation. However, interestingly enough, along "La Mosquita" or the Mosquito Coast, many people continue to speak their native tongue along with English. This was because of British settlements and past British political associations with the Central American Caribbean coastline. However, some of the most neglected parts of Central America, such as the highlands of Guatemala or the western department of Lempira in Honduras, the Lenca and Maya people still speak their native tongue despite the proliferation of Spanish.

Thank you. However, plantations were common in India as well. Some of the earliest uprisings for Independence were started by plantation workers.

 &gt; some of the most neglected parts of Central America, such as the highlands of Guatemala or the western department of Lempira in Honduras, the Lenca and Maya people still speak their native tongue despite the proliferation of Spanish.

It is interesting to me that it is the 'neglected' parts of Central America where people retain their native language. On the other hand, all English-speakers in India (with very few exceptions, such as some North-Eastern States and the cream of the urban elite) are bi-lingual with English as a second-language. Makes me wonder whether the answer lies in the difference in the extent of colonisation by the British in India and by the Spanish in Central America?

Yes, the different levels of development do coincide with the level of language preservation. Another part of Latin America that has had similar results include Paraguay and to a certain extent, Bolivia. Paraguay has a bi-lingual background of both Guarani and Spanish as the official language of the state. In addition, while Bolivia was one of the more developed colonies during the Spanish colonial period, a larger indigenous population did survive both the plague and assimilation. In fact, here is an important point to understand, for a large chunk of Latin America history (1830-1900s), there was a belief in a number of states that indigenous people could never be assimilated  or become citizens of the state. It wasn't until the idea of Indigenismo in the 1920s that a number of states with a heavy indigenous presence, began to believe in the process of assimilating indigenous communities into the citizenry of the state.

Can confirm, I'm traveling through the Guatemalan highlands right now.  There's over 20 (24 I believe) native languages here, and for many Spanish is their second language, if at all.  Fun fact: Qui'che sounds incredibly strange but so cool!

Nicholas Ostler's book "Empires of the Word: A Language History of the World" discusses this topic in some depth. He gives several reasons "why an imperial language lives on after the dissolution of the empire that spread it" (p. 444).

The most relevant reason for Mexico and Latin America is the need to maintain national unity among a diverse group of people. Spain imposed a singe language (Spanish) over a people who spoke many different languages. Abandoning it would have required quickly adopting another language to fill it's place. Ostler points out that after power changes in a country "the language may change too.. but quite likely it does not, especially where there is no conqueror but simply the culmination of a struggle for independence." (p. 444)

As for India, while a majority of people do not speak is as a first language, it's a very prominent second language for many in the country. Ethnologue lists English as having only 350,000 L1 (first language) speakers in India, but 200 million L2 (second language) speakers.

A better example of a colonial language not becoming dominant in a former colonial is Indoesia. Why did Dutch not become the primary language of Indonesia? The Dutch controlled Indonesia (as the Dutch East Indies) for several hundred years, but there are hardly any Dutch speakers there now. The Dutch continued to promote the use of Malay, since that language had already been established as a lingua franca (common language) in the linguistically diverse region for some time.  And so the official language of Indonesia is Indonesia (Bahasa Indonesia), which is a form of Malay. (Note that Indonesian is a second language for a majority of Indonesians. Javanese has more first language speakers.)

I think you are forgetting something important from Ostler's account of the rise of Spanish in the New World, especially Mexico. Because there was already an imperial presence in Mesoamerica prior to the arrival of the Spanish, there existed a *lengua franca* or regional language, what the Spanish called a *lengua general*, that was spoken across linguistic groups. With the arrival of the Spanish, the use of Nahuatl actually *increased* in use geographically. This was similar to the cases of Quechua and Aymara in Peru and was a practical response to the problem of language difference. The literate Spanish had a sophisticated system for learning indigenous languages and it was easier for non-literate Amerindians to learn languages closer in character to their own.

Ostler claims that the spread of Spanish in the New World did not really gain momentum until the 19th century, when independence movements led by creoles insisted on a national language to unify the people. They eliminated indigenous language education and religious services and imposed Spanish in order to create a national identity, thus leading to the reduction of Amerindian language use.

&gt; Ostler claims that the spread of Spanish in the New World did not really gain momentum until the 19th century, when independence movements led by creoles insisted on a national language to unify the people. 

Mexican historian Antonio Garc√≠a Cubas noted that in 1889 about 38% of the Mexican population spoke a Native Mexican language, and that the number of speakers of a Native language in 1820 was of 60% of the population. 

By 1821 (the year Mexico claimed independence from Spain) the Mexican population was 1 million White (Criollos and Peninsulares), 1.3 million Mestizos and 3.6 million Mexican Indigenous. ^[1](http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/geografia/viage4/viageq2b.htm)

First off, I don't think you raise a particular good example. I'm neither a historian or linguist, nor have I even been to India, but my cursory research suggests it's not entirely appropriate to suggest that English is not spoke in India. According to [this article](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~jason2/papers/natlang.htm) English is only spoken by 3-4% of the population, which sounds small. But, India is GIGANTIC, and a lot of people live in rural areas: the same article further suggests that "Although this is a minority, it is perhaps the most elite and influential minority in India today." This is corroborated by [this New York Times piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/world/asia/17iht-letter17.html) which writes:

&gt;  Almost all advertising billboards in India are in English. There is not a single well-paying job in the country that does not require a good understanding of the language. Higher education here is conducted entirely in English. When Hindustan Pencils makes cheap pencils, which its sells to rural children for a rupee apiece (about 2 cents), the company prints the brand name, ‚ÄúJobber,‚Äù in English. ‚ÄúA villager has more respect for a brand that is written in English,‚Äù said Dhruman Sanghvi, a company director.

&gt; English is the de facto national language of India. It is a bitter truth. 

English may not have infiltrated the rural regions nor 96% of the population of India, but it sounds like it is probably pervasive in most if not all of the economic and urban centers of the country. [Politicians (may) even use English to address parliament](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-24997219)

Also, Mexico is FAR from the only country to adopt the language of their colonizers. Consider Brazil, where even most of the native tribes speak portuguese, or better yet, [the francophone diaspora](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:New-Map-Francophone_World.PNG) and of course [the Spanish Diaspora](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_diaspora)

If you don't find a satisfactory response to your main question here, I suggest you consider cross-posting to /r/linguistics or perhaps /r/etymology.

I'd also add how the Spanish ruled Mexico longer than the British ruled India. From 1521 to 1821 (300 years) the Spanish ruled Mexico whereas the British ruled the majority of India from around 1757 to 1957 (200 years).
##
Sorry to be pedantic, but its 1947.
##
Thanks for the reply. I'm Indian, and haven't been to Mexico. As you yourself have pointed out, while English is used by the urban elite, the same is far from true for the majority of the population in India. English is the official language of only one or two states in India. However, based on what I know about Mexico (from American pop-culture, I'll be honest), Spanish appears to be quite prevalent there. 
##
Also remember that around 90% of the native population in many areas of the America s died due to things like disease they weren't prepared for. Most likely the more isolated (jungles, non arable land, mountains etc) areas would have a higher rate of native speakers although I don't have anything to confirm this per say


##
According to the [CIA world fact book](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/in.html):
"English enjoys the status of subsidiary official language but is the most important language for national, political, and commercial communication."  However it does not give an actual percentage.  Wikipedia places it at 10%, though interestingly Pakistan is at 49%.
##
I don't have much to offer on the topic, but would the difference in the amount of people who were there before colonization play a part too? I would imagine that there were far more Hindus in India than there were people from the various tribes of Mexico

Many of the other comments in this thread are good. But everyone is overlooking something absolutely critical to the domination of Spanish in Mexico (and European cultural modes across the Americas in general). From Columbus's first landing to the fall of the last Mesoamerican Empires, it is generally accepted that *90%* of the native population was killed by a combination of warfare, famine, and most importantly disease. That is unprecedented in human history, by an order of magnitude. Quite simply, the cultures that antedated European invasion literally vanished. With that in mind, is it so surprising Spanish, Portuguese, English, and French came to supplant the aboriginal languages in nearly every American locale?

Please do not post such a heated top-level post without substantiated evidence **that actually answers the question.** Spanish atrocities when they came to Mexico were pretty dire, yes. However, that wasn't the question - the only thing that came close was this:

&gt; If you didn't speak Spanish you were basically going to die

...with a wikipedia link. I'm sorry, but please read the post I have in this thread. Then read the link in that post that describes top-level comments. Thanks! :)
##
&gt; If you didn't speak Spanish you were basically going to die

That's nonsense. There were plenty of people on the Spanish Empire that didn't speak Spanish. Plenty of people in Spain itself that didn't too.
