Thepineappleheadress has written a really great response.  I will add a little bit of side information.

By the point in the war when the largest Kamikaze attacks were taking place, Japan was in a desperate situation and everybody knew it.    In March 1945, America had started large scale firebombings of cities, killing hundreds of thousands of civilians.  Okinawa had been invaded.  The people were told it was a struggle for national survival.  

Many kamikaze pilots hoped that they could do something to protect their families.  ALL soldiers in the Japanese military at that point were told that they would be fighting to the death, and there was a widespread expectation of not surving.  Being sent to an island to defend it from the americans was a one way trip.  Staying to defend the home islands meant waiting a little longer to sacrifice your life.    Soldiers would tell their families to  "let's meet at yasukuni."[靖国で会おう]

Even under those circumstances, it was not easy to fly a suicide plane.  Many pilots struggled to be brave enough to carry out their missions.

&gt;Soldiers would tell their families to "meet me at yasukini."

Yasukini being...?
##
Sorry - was typing on my phone while riding a train home.

It was meant to be Yasukuni:  the war shrine in Tokyo where people go to pray to the spirits of the war dead.

Do you have a link to that article or know the title/publication?

The only result I find when I google 'Hamazano kamikaze' is a few quotes in French from former kamikaze pilots.

This is the only quote I can find from Shigeyoshi Hamazano:

&lt;&lt;C’est un pur mensonge je vous assure. Evidemment les cerveaux du QG se sont engagés devant l’Empereur à ne pas imposer ce genre de mission à qui que ce soit et à n’engager que des volontaires mais cette histoire est une belle hypocrisie&gt;&gt;

Translation: "It's a pure lie, I assure you. Evidently, the brains of HQ said in front of the Emperor that they would not impose this kind of mission on anyone and to hire only volunteers, but this story is a great hypocrisy."

Is this quote from the same article?
##
Great story, but you seem to suggest that our hero had some experience in a Zero.  Wouldn't they have been conserving their veterans and mostly sending noobs?
##
The use of specialized kamikaze planes didn't start until almost the very end of the war, so the Zero was responsible for most of the kamikaze attacks on the Allied fleet, and you need some experience to fly it past a screen of defending fighters and hit a carrier.  I don't know if any special effort was made to conserve elite fighter pilots, but when kamikaze attacks became routine there weren't enough left to make a difference in a straight up fight against American airpower anyway.
##
What entails a "specialized" kamakazie plane?
##
Something like the [Yokosuka MXY7 Ohka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokosuka_MXY7_Ohka), perhaps. As far as I know most Kamikaze planes were your usual Imperial Japanese Navy planes with some bombs attached.
##
While some very specific suicide planes were designed, not many were used.  Most planes were standard Zeros, Heins, Oscars, whatever the IJN and IJAAF had extras of lying around.  You get lots of explosives jammed in the nose, and load very little or no ammunition.  

Anything not vital to flying the plane may be stripped out for parts.  Bits of metal, any armor plating, maybe the guns themselves might be stripped.

It would make the plane lighter and faster.  Armor plating I'm not really sure.  It would risk your pilot more before he can carry out his mission, but by that stage in the war, the metal would be better used elsewhere.
##
Not necessarily, [Saburo Sakai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabur%C5%8D_Sakai) had at least 60 kills and was sent on a Kamikaze mission late in the war. He ended up returning to base as he could not reach the ships he was to attack due to the fighter cover. (Short on fuel, wasn't going to reach them, no point going on) He talks about it in his book, [Samurai!](http://www.amazon.com/Samurai-Martin-Caiden/dp/0743412834)
##
Unlike the US Army Air Force, who sent their Aces and Veterans back to the USA to help War Bonds and train Aces in the making, the japanese line of Navy Air Force veterans was thin to nonexistant by '44 as they had lost most of them. 

Germany had a lot of exceptional Aces with really high kill scores, but they also grew thin in the final years of WW2 as, again, they mostly weren't permanently sent back to their home country to advance and improve training.

Then again, Germany did not consider air ramming missions by fighters and interceptors vs bombers as suicide missions.

If you want an even sadder tale than the life of a kamikaze pilot, read up on the Yokosuka MXY7 Ohka.
##
Going from memory: the Ohka was a rocket-powered bomb, made from wood, that also required a "live guidance unit". It would be dropped from a conventional bomber mothership then dive on its target. No defensive armament and minimal armour; it relied on its speed to try to beat defenders.

I don't recall how widespread their service was or which battles they might've been deployed in.

Think of the goblin-bombs from Warhammer Fantasy.
##
They also had a 'live-guidance' torpedo they had hoped to use. Desperation and a culture of honour are a dangerous mix.
##
I'm confused, did he still wish he had died in an attack by the time he gave the interview?  Or did he just mean he wished for death back in 1945?
##
&gt;there's a huge, huge, huge stigma against Kamikaze pilots

Do you mean in Japan? If so, can you flesh that out a little bit because I had never heard of such a thing.
##
The Japanese language can actually be kind of ambiguous about things like that.  I suppose the best way to know for sure would be to find his actual comments in Japanese rather than the translated ones that Time posted.
##
Ah, interesting- could you explain the grammer ambiguity a bit more please?
##
The past and the past perfect don't really exist as separate grammatical structures in Japanese; "I wished I had died" and "I wish I had died" would be translated the same way, and in order to separate them, you'd need additional context "At the time, I wished I had died, but now I'm glad that I didn't."

When languages don't necessarily map one-to-one like this, it's easy for even advanced speakers/translators to not get the nuance 100% right.

I'm not saying that I'm an advanced speaker by any stretch of the imagination; I'm just saying that what Mr. Hamazono said might have been open to interpretation.
##
I took a course on Modern Japan where we covered the kamikaze pilots. I'm not quite sure what the textbook was but we read the following passage here from diaries of those who were in close proximity to the pilots close to their final mission: 

&gt;At the hall where their farewell parties were held, the young student officers drank cold sake the night before their flight. Some gulped the sake in one swallow; others kept gulping down [a large amount]. The whole place turned to mayhem. Some broke hanging light bulbs with their swords. Some lifted chairs to break the windows and tore white tablecloths. A mixture of military songs and curses filled the air. While some shouted in rage, others cried aloud. It was their last night of life. They thought of their parents, their faces and images, lovers’ faces and their smiles, a sad farewell to their fiancées—all went through their minds like a running-horse lantern [a rapidly revolving lantern with many pictures on it]. Although they were supposedly ready to sacrifice their precious youth the next morning for imperial Japan and for the emperor, they were torn beyond what words can express—some putting their heads on the table, some writing their wills, some folding their hands in meditation, some leaving the hall, and some dancing in a frenzy while breaking flower vases. They all took off wearing the rising sun headband the next morning. But this scene of utter desperation has hardly been reported. I observed it with my own eyes, as I took care of their daily life, which consisted of incredibly strenuous training, coupled with cruel and torturous corporal punishment as a daily routine.

I found that here: http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/619508.html

The profound swings of emotion even after they were indoctrinated to believe that they were fighting for their Emperor, God, and the most important nation in the world are very harrowing. I can only imagine what it must have been like facing death in the eye like that. 
##
Since you've studied the subject, was there a military advantage to using Kamikaze pilots? Isn't a plane a ton of money and better used repeatedly?
##
I am not exactly an expert on the topic but I know a little. I think there were several factors at play. 

1. They only began to use kamikaze pilots towards the end of the war (late 1944) and after the US navy was making inroads into the pacific. It could be argued that they were using the kamikazes as a sort of stalling technique to damage or destroy US ships therefore allowing more time for the defence of the homeland. 

2. They could in no way match the output of the United States so they had to use what they had. They had a lot of outdated aircraft that could not face the US planes in a head on fight but could be loaded with munitions and crashed into ships. They also had a lot of men who, due to the culture, were in a way coerced into performing these attacks. 

3. The culture itself. The Japanese were harking back to the days of the samurai, they believed death before dishonour. They would rather die than surrender to the allies, they would die fighting for the homeland, they saw this as more honourable. 
4. It also had a massive effect on the US morale at the time, they were fighting a very determined force and a kamikaze could come from anywhere at any time. 

In reality only around 14% of kamikaze pilots actually hit their targets, but this in a way is a more effective use of the 4,000 pilots who died in kamikaze attacks. They didn't have enough modern planes or experienced pilots to effectively wage war. 
##
To add on a bit to your first point, it could also be argued that it was a psychological tactic meant to attack morale and engender questions among their enemies - if the Japanese are willing to fly a plane into our ship, what else are they willing to do and how can we fight an enemy like that?
##
Viewing the responses so far, its apparent that many more than just one factor led to the eventual use of kamikaze pilots. Such influences as the population's intense nationalism coupled with aging military hardware set the stage for the use of such strategies as kamikaze, but by far the most influential factor was the vanishing Japanese oil inventories during WWII. These influenced Japan's military strategic decisions in multiple ways, including cutting new pilot training to just 30 hours to avoid using fuel in non-combat scenarios, directing naval carrier forces to approach American fleets directly rather than circuitously, despite the disadvantage it created for Japanese battleships, and of course using Kamikazes, as they were fairly successful as a weapon and only needed enough fuel for one way. The planes were valuable, sure, but Japan was so strapped for oil that they couldn't afford to use them for anything else. 

It's actually very interesting to read about the lengths that the Japanese government was willing to go to to conserve fuel. Many non-military campaigns were initiated as well, some were pretty crazy. Japan tried a "pine-needles campain" to convert pine needles into biofuel, with moderately low success. Eventually Japan was so desperate for fuel that the government was literally starving it's citizens to death so they could use the rice as biomass in the biofuel synthesis process.
##
Kamikaze attacks had no military value.  They did this because they basically didn't have enough ammo or fuel to wage conventional attack against Allied fleet.  It was a tactic devised by fanatics who refused to accept defeat and believe that devine intervention will somehow bring victory to Japan.  Kamikaze means "god's wind" and before WWII, it was the name given to the storm that sank Mongolian ships that came to invade Japan.  (My memory on Japanese history is little hazy so it might have been Chinese that try to invade.)
##
It isn't true they have no military value. Yes, they had no strategic value. But tactically, they were somewhat effective. 

&gt;Approximately 2,800 Kamikaze attackers sunk 34 Navy ships, damaged 368 others, killed 4,900 sailors, and wounded over 4,800. Despite radar detection and cuing, airborne interception and attrition, and massive anti-aircraft barrages, a distressing 14 percent of Kamikazes survived to score a hit on a ship; nearly 8.5 percent of all ships hit by Kamikazes sank

But from a strategic perspective, these losses meant little to the US. 
##
Honest question: What is the difference between a **tactical** value and a **strategic** value?
##
Tactical - thinking in terms of the battle/mission at hand, i.e. sinking an American ship.

Strategic - thinking in terms of the long term goals of your war, and how you want to achieve them - e.g. a lost ship or 34 was irrelevant to the outcome of the war and a pointless loss of life on both side.
Hope that helps! :)
##
tactical - small, localized value - of use in an individual battle

strategic - much more overarching - used to refer to entire battle plans

tactics happen on the ground; strategies happen on paper

**You can use guerrilla warfare on the ground as your tactical style and you can fight a guerrilla war as a matter of principle as your strategy.**
##
It is, to a degree, the difference between short term and long term value. Tactical is about specifics - a tactical victory is success in a given operation, mission or objective. A strategic victory would be something contributing to the overall success of a war. The two are not mutually exclusive, but it is possible to have tactical success but not strategic success, and vice versa. 

The battle of bunker hill is a good example. The British completed the objective and took the hill. It came with a very high casualty count however (leading to a joke among Americans that they'd be happy to sell the British another hill at the same price, as they'd be all out of soldiers before they reached the end of the state!). So it can be considered a tactical victory by the British but a strategic victory for the Americans. 

So in this case, kamikaze may have tactical value - it can help sink ships and add to a given battle. But in the long run, the United States still has plenty more to throw in and can relatively easily replace lost ships and men, so they had little strategic value in terms of seriously affecting the US war effort. 

I'm not as well versed in military history as others on this sub though, so if I happen to be wrong feel free to correct me and I'll remove the comment. 
##
Tactics are how you take the hill.  Strategy is how you decide which hill to take.
##
Tactical is "can this win a battle"

Strategic is "can this win a war"

So tactically throwing planes at ships might turn the tide of a battle. Strategically it'd be better to conserve both the expensive planes and trained pilots for another engagement.

Same thing with the doctrine with Veteran pilots. The Allies would cycle veterans back to train pilots while the Germans and Japanese would keep them in service. So the Allies may not have as many ace pilots in any engagement but the quality of pilots as a whole would rise. 

##
This is encapsulated in one of my favourite quotes from Sun Tzu's the Art of War: "Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory."

So tactics are about the instantaneous decisions about how to win individual battles, but strategy is about how the individual battles fit into a greater picture.

This idea, that a victory tactically could cause a loss strategically is ancient. The phrase "Pyrrhic victory" refers to the ancient Greek Pyrrhus of Epirus, who fought the roman empire. He was considered one of the greatest military commanders of his time, and won many battles, but by ignoring the strategic picture, still lost everything.

Hannibal similarly was famous for the same problem: He didn't lose a single major battle over his campaign, but lost to Rome, because despite incredible prowess tactically, the battles being won were not important, and simply drained the invading force.

##
Tactics are what accomplish a stated and immediate goal - kill sailors, sink ships. Strategy is about whether you can use available resources and tactics to achieve a different campaign outcome - a willingness to run kamikaze missions was psychologically drastic, but did not force the U.S. to engage the Japanese fleet differently, delay any battles, or change control of any critical strongholds.
##
Speaking roughly, tactical applies to a single battle/skirmish, whereas strategic would apply to an entire campaign.

The use of kamikaze's in a single battle would cause damage to the US forces engaged in that battle, so if the Japanese won that would  be a tactical victory. On a strategic scale, the US fighting potential would be largely unhindered by this, as their forces were numerically superior (in the latter stages at least). It could even be a strategic loss for the Japanese, as they were losing men and planes for little overall effect.

I could be very wrong, but I think that's roughly what the difference is :P




##
Look at the math on this. 14% of planes hit a ship. 8% of those ships that were hit were sunk. That equates to a roughly 1% rate to sink a ship. You're sending 100 aircraft and 100 men to destruction to sink one ship. There isn't an Air Force that can sustain that rate for long before running out of planes, pilots, or both. 
##
You're right, it was the Mongolians, but part of the reason that the *kamikaze* became such a part of their national history was that it happened TWICE.  In 1274 and again in 1281, the Mongolians showed up with ludicrously large assault fleets trying to set up beachheads on the home islands.  Both times, the Japanese held them off just barely long enough - first through sheer body count, hurling soldiers, militia, farmers, whoever at them to cover the retreat of their main forces, and second because they'd spent the intervening years building huge sea walls - for *taifun* to come and obliterate the fleet.  

Both times the Mongolians had more than enough forces at least to start a takeover of the main islands.  The *kamikaze* make a pretty persuasive argument for some sort of divine protector, and that's the concept that the Japanese of the 1940s were trying to channel.
##
It was Kublai Kahn who ordered the invasion, since he was both Kahn of the Mongolians and the founder of the Yuan Dynasty in China, you could argue that either Chinese or Mongolian is correct.
##
It was orchestrated by the Mongolian Empire, with an invasion force consisting of Mongolian, Chinese and Korean soldiers. 

China at the time was the major part of the Mongolian Empire. Korea (Goryeo Dynasty at the time) was a vassal. So at the time it was a Mongolian/Korean invasion. You can however say that it involved three broad groups, those we consider ethnically Chinese, ethnically Mongolian and ethnically Korean (there are numerous sub groups within each ethnicity). 

Saying it was a Mongolian invasion is mostly correct, since all participants were under Mongolian control. Saying it was Chinese is not really correct, since that excludes the Mongols and Koreans who were part of the invasion. 
##
You're correct. Mongol emperor Kiblia Khan attacked in 1274 and again in 1282. Both times foiled by fortuitous storms. 
##
Like Germany, Japan produced remarkable numbers of airplanes right up until the end. Also like Germany, their problem was a lack of trained pilots, most of whom had been killed in front-line duty in the Pacific. By the end of the war, most Japanese planes were single-use whether they were kamikazes or not, thanks to the swarms of better-trained American pilots flying superior planes.

A kamikaze pilot was much cheaper to train than a regular pilot (takeoff and landing are usually the most difficult parts of flying, and not necessary skills for a suicide pilot). The amount of explosive carried by a kamikaze was relatively huge, amounting to more than a normal plane's full bomb load plus the gas left in its tanks. And it was far easier to steer a plane into a ship than to drop a bomb on it or launch a torpedo at it.

In fact, kamikazes did a staggering amount of damage to the US fleet (although not enough to matter to the final outcome). They would certainly have done much greater damage had it not been for their tendency to attack the first ships they saw, which were usually destroyers and destroyer escorts placed on "picket" duty, and if not for the huge numbers of fighters on defensive patrol and the enormous number of anti-aircraft guns in the later-war US fleets.

I feel that if Japan had employed kamikazes at the start of the war, when we had far fewer planes and ships and far fewer antiaircraft guns on the ships (and no radar proximity-fused shells), we would simply have been unable to get any ships within 500 miles of any Japanese airbase, which would certainly have affected the course of the war.
##
One Former Japanese pilot said it would have been effective the first few times but the enemy would have obviously adapted hence it was a really bad tactic to continue endlessly.

It's in the book " I was a kamikaze pilot" by Ryuji Natgatsuka.


##
&gt; Like Germany, Japan produced remarkable numbers of airplanes right up until the end.

Are you sure about this? The Japanese aircraft engine industry was pretty pathetic (engines are usually the limiting factor.) At Coral Sea, the light carrier Ryujo was still flying A5Ms, with an open cockpit and fixed landing gear, for lack of enough modern planes. I know also that there was a desperate shortage of aircraft with high enough performance to catch the B-29s once that started, and attempts to goose production were basically ineffective.
##
Generally, yes. I don't know about the particular reasons they were used by Japan, but sending people on one way missions might be made necessary if for example; the carrier the planes are stationed on cannot get close enough to the target to allow the planes to return. Another possible reason is that a pilot guiding a plane with lots of explosives attached to it might be more likely to destroy its target than a dropped bomb. This second possible reason is no longer applicable, guided weapons are far more precise than the pilots launching them, but it was applicable at some points in the past.

Finally, the last reason I can think of is if the number of sorties that need to be flown are beyond the logistical capabilities of a fleet, not having to land, refuel, repair, and rearm the planes might allow a fleet to carry out the required number of sorties at the cost of a significant number of aircraft and personnel. One would only do this in an incredibly desperate or important situation.

But this is just speculation, so if someone can provide a sourced opinion, go with theirs.
##
The plane is secondary to the skill of the pilot. But if you don't have the fuel to train a pilot (much less build better planes that would allow you to compete equally) then this becomes your only option. 


That or surrender but who'd do that in the face of a massive allied fleet backed by a massive allied army with material superiority?
##
For a first-hand account from an American-born kamikaze, check out the autobiography of Shigeo Imamura:  http://www.kamikazeimages.net/books/personal/imamura/index.htm
##
I'm always amazed by the idea we have of how the men of long ago didn't fear death. We build them up in our stories to go to battle yearning for death in the name of whatever flag is flying behind them. Nobody lies on a battlefield bleeding to death having a peaceful death waiting to go to heaven for their honor. They were men with fears and regrets the same as the men of today.
##
Did the families of the kamikaze pilots get any compensation or pension for their sons' deaths? I don't know much about life in Japan during that time, but it seems like removing the stronger young men from the workforce would make it harder for families to support themselves. Or were there few enough kamikaze pilots that it wasn't any different from the other young men killed in action?
##
Did the families still receive pension even though the war was lost and Japan was under American occupation?
##
Greetings visitors from /r/bestof! Making a mod note here as I've had to do quite a bit of clean up, so please [be mindful of our rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules) and don't post off-topic chatter. 
##
Correction: Most Kamikazes were actually former students.  The Kamikaze program didn't take off until midway through the war when the Japanese were getting desperate.  Up until then the students had been left in school, but when the country grew low on munitions, metal and men, they were drafted out of the universities and coerced into joining the program.  
Due to the fact that they were smarter than the average soldier, they were encouraged to write diaries to cope with their mission, hence why there are so many first hand accounts of life as a Kamikaze (before the mission).  
##
A quick question. How hard was it for them to fly out, then fly somewhere completely different, land the plane and go hide? Did that happen? Why wouldn't it be possible?
##
Fly to where? Japan was an Island country, and the land nearby that was not Japanese controlled would generally be Allied control (i.e. enemy territory). What do you think the chances are of a Japanese zero making an impromptu landing on an allied airfield without getting shot to hell would be? Moreover, it's not as though most of the time a kamikaze pilot would be flying alone and unsupervised.
##
There have been other pilot defections in war, at least a couple from N. Korea and Vietnam.  I think they just come in low and slow, gear and flaps down, and make it very obvious they are trying to land.  Now, I've never heard if a Japanese pilot defected.  I'd love to know if it ever happened!
##
The Japanese committed alot of tactics to track enemy troops and attack by surprised, ex: surrendering  with live grenades in clothing and in armpits. Airfield personnel would have heard of such stories and would have assumed it a trick to get through defenses. 
##
&gt; surrendering with live grenades in clothing and in armpits.

Source? I'd like to know more about Japanese tactics like this.
##
&gt;There were numerous allegations that Japanese troops feigned surrender in order to kill the Allied troops attempting to receive their surrender, often with a concealed grenade. Following the battle of the Tenaru River on Guadalcanal, wounded Japanese shot a number of Marines who had come to their assistance, and the Marines responded by firing additional rounds into all the Japanese bodies on the battlefield. Vandegrift was shocked by the incident, and wrote to the Marine Corps commandant, Thomas Holcomb (Frank 1990):

    General, I have never heard or read of this kind of fighting. These people refuse to surrender. The wounded wait until men come up to examine them ... and blow themselves and the other fellow to pieces with a hand grenade.



http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/S/u/Surrender.htm

All I could find.
##
I've never read of them defecting and landing on a US air strip but there were situations where they landed on US air strips not realizing it wasn't under Japanese control.  I believe these all ended with a ton of small arms fire at the plane on the ground until the pilot was killed. 
##
Also towards the end of the war, Kamikaze pilots flew the [Ohka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohka).  It didn't have landing gear, instruments, or anything beyond a control stick, switches to turn on the rockets, and a switch to arm the bomb.
##
Those were used in very limited numbers, though. For the most part, piston-engine aircraft were still the predominant kamikaze weapon until the end. 
##
Not strictly true. Ohka [does have](http://inflight.squarespace.com/storage/post-images/Ohka-cockpit..jpg) some instruments.
##
If a pilot tried to abandon their mission they'd have problems. The primary reason that Japan started using this tactic was that, as the war went on, they ran into a shortage of trained pilots. Japan isn't a big island, so they were always outnumbered.

In other words, it cost more (time and money) to train a competent pilot than it did to build a  plane. So kamikaze pilots learned how to take off (the easy part) but not how to land (the hard part).

Think of the savings! Create a giant, virtually unstoppable bomb -- unused fuel + a heavy chunk of metal -- without needing to train a new pilot or supply a full complement of ammunition.

Add to that the bonuses of (1) internal propaganda about loyalty, plus (2) the fear inspired in the enemy stemming from the obvious, unrivaled dedication of the pilots and you've got yourself a worthwhile, cost-effective approach.

So long as you don't see the loss of life on your own side as a cost, of course.
##
I recall an account of a kamikaze pilot setting his plane down in the surf of a Pacific Island, and with hand gestures begging some US Marines to cut him free - the canopy of his aircraft had been wired shut, so that if he tried to land he'd probably die either from drowning (a water landing) or trapped in the burning wreckage (on dry land).
##
What happened to him?
##
He was rescued and went into captivity, if I recall.
##
Do you have a source for this.  I burn to know more. 
##
The kamikaze affair was born out of despair and urgency. The american forces were advancing steadily with great numbers and superior machines. Japan would send a thousand planes and few would come back. They seldom ever accomplished anything. 

Midway saw virtually the entirety of IJN's top pilots and equipment to the button of the ocean. The Marianas turkey shoot saw the flaming death of nearly a thousand Japanese pilots. Then there's a long list catastrophe including Truk (which is little known, considering the actual impact it had). 

They could not seam to successfully defend anything. They'd send out all they've got and get little more than death and destruction in return. They desperately needed more pilots and planes but they had no time to train them properly and the planes were largely outclassed by then. So they started to train the recruit just enough to take off, hold a heading and crash dive. Literally. They were all gonna die anyway. There's no stopping the *American giant*. Might as well try to accomplish something... 

My source for this is Samurai! by Saburo Sakai.
##
IJN did not lose that many pilots at midway, they did lose 200+ aircraft but many of those were destoryed on the deck of the carriers and most pilots were eventually rescued and made it back to Japan. 

Most IJN pilots were lost to attrition during the Solomons campaign in which they take off from land in Rabaul, fly 650 miles to Guadalcanal and must turn back after 30 minutes; if they sustain any major damage in battle they are very unlikely to survive the 650 mile return trip. 

By 1944 most Japanese pilots were rookies and that is part of the reason why Ozawa's plan for Marianas fell apart so quickly - the pilots are just not as good as they once were
##
Sources? I've asked repeatedly on here for reading material on Japanese propaganda during WW2, specifically about the Government using Bushido to convince normal people to fight. People have given me little to nothing to go off of. Any ideas?
##
There's also a really fascinating strain of things I've read that connected kamikaze to the "Three Flesh Bullets" in Shanghai and to... a wave of lovers' suicides in the early 1930s, triggered by the double suicide of [two Christian students who jumped into Saktayama volcano](http://books.google.com/books?id=7HTfGRRllAQC&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;ots=6ljOUGurLX&amp;dq=goro%20yaeko%20suicide&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage&amp;q=goro%20yaeko%20suicide&amp;f=false), which inspired hundreds of copycats (including the high-profile suicide of teenage girl, [Kiyoko Matsumoto, who jumped into the thousand-foot crater of a volcano on the island of Oshima](http://drvitelli.typepad.com/providentia/2013/02/the-volcano-suicide-craze.html).) Both stories inspired movies and plays, as well as lots of news coverage. And waves of copycats. 

The press took the romantic love theme and used it in comparison to the love of country displayed by the valiant but doomed soldiers in China. 

When I first started reading about this, it was mainly out of interest in suicide bombing - the Flesh Bullets make a convenient starting point for  "the modern suicide bomber"... or at least an interesting prelude to the Japanese Red Army bringing suicide attacks as a strategy to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. 

Which is a kind of interesting cultural connection. 

I wrote some notes when I was looking into this connection [over here](http://www.barbelith.com/topic/10580). Some of the links are dead, but the one with Peter High's take on the connection between the Lovers' Suicide Rage, Japanese media and kamikazes is still [live](http://pears.lib.ohio-state.edu/Markus/kjthreads/satchi.html) (and told more professionally in [High's book on Japanese film history](http://books.google.com/books?id=6XiA9DOuvjAC&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;ots=_3VCPuRyLq&amp;dq=Chosho%20Goro&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q=Chosho%20Goro&amp;f=false)).

&gt; [T]he subsequent Shanghai Incident of spring 1932... was given "transcendent" significance by digging out extraordinary examples of self-sacrificial valor displayed by individuals or small groups of military men involved in the fighting there.The narrative category for such exemplary incidents is as ancient as the medieval era *senki-mono*, such military histories as the *Taiheiki* etc. This was the *BIDAN* (lit. "beautiful tale"). Before coming upon the single ideal *bidan* for the Incident, we find the press almost daily putting forward various candidates in the form of little front page accounts of "brave deaths" on the battlefields to the north and west of the city. The one they finally settled involved three youing men who died while trying to blow up enemy barbed wire defenses. *Tokyo Nichinichi* immediately dubbed them "Our Three Human Bomb Patriots" (*Bakudan Sanyushi*), while *Asahi* used the term "Three Flesh-bullet Patriots" (*Nikudan Sanyushi*); it is usually under the latter name that they are referred to in the history books. Within weeks, the Flesh-bullet Three became the subject of radio plays, "quickie" (*kiwamono*) movies, *rakugo* routines and even full-scale stage plays.  

In the media, that China coverage overlaps and mimics something else going on with young people: 
 
&gt; For example, returning to our early thirties parallel, we find the great Lovers' Suicide Rage of 1932-34. On May 10, 1932, the newspapers reported the suicide of Chosho Goro, a Keio University student, and his sweetheart Yaeko. The two had met at a Christian fellowship meeting and fallen in love, but because of class differences, marriage had been forbidden by both sets of parents. The means of death they chose was both romantic and striking. They jumped into the Sakatayama volcano above the beach at Oiso. The day after the initial news report, all of the national papers published their suicide note, in which they told (the entire nation, as it turned out) that they had died "pure in body and spirit." At *Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun*, the copy editor had the inspiration to play up the Christian connection, publishing the note under the headline "A Love That Reached Heaven". It was the headline's brilliant balance of spirituality and barely suppressed eros, more than the actual event, which created the greatest sensation and set off the subsequent chain of events. Within days, the suicide was being re-enacted as a play by various small stage troupes using the headline as their title. Radio too picked up the story, first in editorial commentary and then as a radio drama. Record producers released a number of sentimental ballads extolling the pure love of Goro and Yaeko, and Shochiku film company announced it would produce *A Love That Reached Heaven*, with Gosho Heinosuke as director.By this time, the surge of copy-cat suicides (i.e. the "clustering effect") had begun . From mid-May, several couples a day were climbing the slopes of Sakatayama to throw themselves into the volcano.... 
&gt; 
&gt; Now, with the movie, their numbers doubled. At the movie theaters, usherettes had to patrol the aisles as young couples had taken to drinking poison during the showing. By the end of the year, there had been hundreds of suicides. After a brief lull, the Lover`s Suicide Rage flared anew. On January 9 (1933), a pair of school girls climbed Miharayama volcano on Oshima Island, a short ferry trip from Tokyo, and, holding hands, jumped in. The first copy-cat suicides began three days later. 
&gt;

So with the patriotrism and romance of suicide in volcanos and on the battlefield as a backdrop, kamikaze-specific propaganda might not need to be too overstated....

There would often also be a ritual in preparation for a kamikaze mission in which the pilot would spend time with their family if possible and have a good large meal. They would be cleaned and shaved and given new clothes. They would often leave their family without telling them they would not be returning. 

The ceremony leading up to actually flying the mission involved much ritual, and often much drinking of sake. Many pilots carried cherry blossom branches ( a military symbol of the transience of life and the honor and sacrifice of the dying soldiers) in the cockpits with them. In the first few minutes of the following link, and throughout, you can see film of kamikaze pilot ceremonies.  
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=za-YGYP35Zs

**85% of Kamikaze pilots were student-soldiers, many of them a part of the intellectual elite, not simply peasants 
from poorer areas.** (Morioka [1995b] and Ninagawa [1998])
##
Got to call some corrections here. Many kamikaze pilots were highly educated university students/graduates. They were not ill-informed manual workers. In many cases they were not victims of propaganda but were perfectly aware of the madness of the politics going on around them.

Happy to post sources later if people are interested.

Okay, thank you!
##
Also whereas what is considered common knowledge varies by demographics, in many instances for words a few or many people should know in spoken language, but maybe not in their written kanji form, Japanese publications tend to use furigana as a reading aid, which is the practice of including the syllabic spelling of the word in the syllabic characters (Normally Hiragana, IDK if there are situations where katakana is used instead) alongside the Kanji writting for those readers that do not know the kanji form.

[Here you can see more on furigana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furigana)
##
I was going to say- you never mentioned the Bushido / Samurai way as they were taught: *"The way of the Samurai is in death."*

"During the second world war Hagakure was carried by the Kamikaze pilots. Very few of these copies now exist as after the war the occupational forces ordered them to be destroyed. There are perhaps three reasons why they related to this book. Firstly and naturally is their identifying with the passage Shinu beki mitsuketari. The second is that a great number of these pilots were from Saga, the home of the Hagakure. The pilots were trained at an airfield at nearby Metabaru (still a self defence force base) A ceremony was held, and they flew to Kagoshima to refuel before going out over the Pacific."

Copy of the Hagakure and story here: http://www.hyoho.com/Hagakure1.html

Interesting that the Meiji dynasty was able to convince their mostly non-smaurai population to believe the samurai ethos.
##
Just thought as an interesting side story, I would mention the USS Laffey on which my brother served. It was called "the ship that would not die" and in one day survived 6 kamikaze attack and 4 bombs among other things.

It is now moored near the USS Yorktown in Charleston.

Awesome post. Do you think there would be any significant differences in the lives of a Kamikaze pilot and a [Kaiten](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiten) pilot? 
##
Can you please share information insofar as it relates to WWII and Kagoshima, as well as the pilots from there who spoke in "code" (Kagoshima-ben)? 
##
Did kamikazes engage in plane on plane dog fights during their "ultimate mission" or was their sole purpose during that mission to ram into a ship, since their plane was loaded with explosives and I'd imagine would be a lot heavier and slower?
##
A course on Japanese Religion went over this very topic... Many of the historic religious figures of Japan had differing ideals, as shown...

*The body of the Japanese aircraft bumped as the landing gear folded into place. The pilot had begun his honorable mission, and there was no turning back. He eyed the explosives piled around the cockpit, checking to see that the liftoff had not disturbed them. He pulled the control yoke to the right and banked the aircraft at a sharp angle, due west… As he returned the yoke to its resting position, his eyes strayed to his hands, normally solid as vice grips. They were shaking. He gripped the molded rubber a bit harder, and let out an audible scoff. He had no doubts; he was doing the right thing. He thought back to all of the lessons he had learned over the course of his nineteen years on Hahanarudaichi. “We are at war… Society has lost its harmonious balance in the wake of our violence and destruction. By not living in harmony, we have lost honor…My sacrifice today, will be one step closer to achieving our goal, to bring peace back to Japan. By living gloriously and dying valiantly, I will be part of the wonderful solution. What an honor it would be if my historic senseis could speak to me, on my journey to the end, and the beginning!”*

*The incessant vibration and noise of the aircraft vanished, and he felt a wonderful peace wash over him.* 

*Izanagi: “Do not despair, young and honorable hero…you are so close to helping restore the ever wondrous harmonious balance of Kami. Kami is the source of all things, and the connection between all things. Izanumi and I created this world in all its fullness, and now the harmony is in danger. The community is falling apart. I know you understand that your sacrifice will bring honor to our wonderful nation, and will help in restoring harmony between men. The nature of creation is with you, the wonderful reality of your world is with you, and the divine are with you always. You have truly understood your place in history and communal society and are now close to completing your duty. You have truly achieved WA…Be proud my fearless warrior…”*

*Honen: “What are you doing, young child? Do you truly believe in the depths of your heart that killing these people will be honorable? The beliefs of others matter not, as long as we do the noble deed of attempting to show them the correct path. Misguided, they may be… But destroying a fellow man that does not know the way to enlightenment without presenting him with the directions to enlightenment is the worst possible action. You have the knowledge, yet are not gracious enough to share that knowledge with others? You dishonor your ancestors… I put off my enlightenment for the sole purpose of guiding my fellow men towards greatness. All of the knowledge I have attained would be for NOTHING if I cast them off of the cliff the moment before they reach the summit…Think upon this, child, before you carry out what others have told you is a ‘noble’ quest…”*

*Nichiren: “Onward, valiant bird of prey! Do not let yourself think for one second that what you know to be true in your heart is false. The truth you seek, you have always known. No words can describe it. These western enemies place their faith solely in the words of a book, and do not understand the truth that lies within them. Within me, the realities of Shinto and Buddhism have merged into one wonderful unity. The false religions they have imposed upon us is exactly why the harmony and balance of society is crumbling…they are the cause of our problems, and they will soon learn the truth. Over the course of time, the false religions of Japan have been lost, leaving only the correct path. Now we begin the journey to do the same to all the world’s false religions. Become part of the army that extinguishes the plague that they bring to our shores. May the wind carry you to the destination of greatness, fearless eagle…”*

*The roar of the aircraft’s propellers shook the pilot from his state, and he looked to the horizon at the growing smudges that would become his enemy target. He knew what he must do. Even though he had just received incredibly conflicting words of wisdom, one underlying theme rose to the top: “The harmony of my nation is in danger…Although I am small, I can be the one piece necessary to restore the perfect balance that ensures happiness of my society and culture… To turn back now would be to disregard the only correct action. I must act. I have attained Wa… My place in society is to be the solution to the growing problem.. Thank you senseis, your wisdom is great and true.”  His smile grew, and a tear rolled down his cheek. In utter bliss, the pilot shoved the throttle forward and dove.*

I heard they also took meth before flights. Is it true?
##
Amphetamine was created in 1887 (in Germany I think), then methamphetamine was synthesized from ephedrine (chemically very closely related) in 1893 by a Japanese chemist. Crystal meth was later synthesized by a Japanese pharmacologist in 1919.

Meth got used by many in the Japanese military, of particular note is usage among soldiers in ground battles on islands throughout the south-pacific. In "The Ghost Mountain Boys" by James Campbell it's mentioned that soldiers and officers in Papua New Guinea were issued supplies of meth (offhand I'm not sure in what form) as well as cocaine. During one encounter where Allied forces overran a Japanese field base the Allied soldiers found a number of Japanese officers completely inebriated and only partly clothed in a room with prayer items and a cache of drugs.

Amphetamine and methamphetamine, both dopamine reuptake inhibitors, are more frequently referred to by the colloquial name "speed" and were also issued to individuals in the US Army Air Force during WW2 and allegedly well beyond that time period. I think there's a thread in /r/AskHistorians that goes into that.

wow, i thought it was a little more rare than this.  Do you know how many kamikaze attacks there were in WWII?
##
When during this process would the pilots become aware that it was a suicide mission?
##
My grandfather was drafted to be a suicide bomber when he was 19. He was just a boy from a small fishing town. He was told to strap a bomb to his back and swim into the harbor and cling onto enemy ships should they ever reach Japan. This description is very accurate and perfectly exemplifies the sense of duty and the unspoken fear they felt. He just passed away a month ago. He was the last of his regimen to die. I wish I could have translated this comment to him. Thank you!

Chinese characters are used in the Japanese language(3 scripts), as well as in the Korean Language (Hanja) the 3 share alot in common in terms of culture because they're neighbors in the Far East... hope that clears things up.

One of the most effective means of causing massive damage to an overwhelming enemy. These were mostly pilots that had very little flying experience (no fuel to practice flying with), poor flying instructors (pilots never left combat positions to go train other pilots, they flew until they died or were too badly injured), and obsolete planes (the economy of Japan was very poor for fighting such a massive war). They predominately died in the air (being shot down by planes or antiaircraft fire), on the ground (preemptive air strikes by the US), or in the sea (could not find a target or bad navigation, running out of fuel). The few pilots who did find a target usually went after the first ship they saw, which were picket destroyers in front of the fleet (dozens were sunk or badly damaged). Only a very few actually hit a ship that would be considered a worthwhile target.

 Even with all this preventing a suicide pilot from being effective, they still managed to damage or sink over 600 US ships and kill 6,000 navy personnel. Sometimes there were more casualties at sea than there were in the worst of the fighting by soldiers on the islands.

 They were a force that caused immense concern in the highest levels of the US government. The casualties of the invasion of mainland Japan of both US and Japanese would have been in the tens of millions. The atomic bombs gave a way for the government of Japan to surrender as the military would have continued their suicide campaign to the bitter end.

 In the annals of history, the Kamikaze pilots will be forever remembered.
##
The first kamikaze unit was led by Commander Asaiki Tamai. He asked 23 airforce students if they were to voluntere for the mission, in which everyone raised both there hands an voluntered. The only person in the first mission to have not voluntered was Lieutenant Yukio Seki, he was asked by Commander Tamai to lead the mission in which Seki lowered his head and thought for ten seconds, before answering "Please do appoint me to the post." Though Seki later said that "Japan's future is bleak if it is forced to kill one of its best pilots." and "I am not going on this mission for the Emperor or for the Empire... I am going because I was ordered to."
Which shows that when some of the volunteres was asked if they wanted to die for their countries future, some might have said yes even though they felt pressured to accept and really didn't want to at heart.

Seki was asked if he wanted to voluntere for the mission sometime in September 1944. He married his wife just a year before the mission, but they most likely didn't meet before his end because he was stationed in Taiwan. The mission itself took place on October 25, 1944, so the gap between voluntering and the mission was about a month. What the soldiers did during that period I don't actually know, maybe someone else have more details about that.

Were these attacks really worth it?  To me it doesn't seem like it.  An entire plane and a pilot with many many hours of training for damage to an enemy ship seems like an extremely high cost.  Not to mention the impact this would have on morale of the other men.
##
Not to attempt to justify the insane nature of suicide attacks. But in all honesty given that the cream of the crop of Japan's pilots had been exhausted, her carriers destroyed and facing an increasingly grim outlook by late 1943 through 1945. The Suicide attacks were not as crazy as they might appear on the surface.

Pilots with minimal flight training (a few hours in most cases) and no combat flight experience could effectively become smart bombs capable of guiding themselves right into enemy ships with far higher rates of accuracy then conventional bombs of torpedoes. Coming in at extremely high angles and rates of speed meant that they were quite hard to hit and flak fire often couldn't destroy them before impact. 

Given the extremely high value of Aircraft Carriers, Japan hoped to cripple the US Fleet by hitting these and other vital targets. Thusly making the invasion of the home Japanese islands much more costly to the Americans, who they felt had weak stomachs for causalities. A suicide pilot hoped that his sacrifice would save many more of his countrymen from the enemy. 

But despite early success and a number of sinkings and substantial blows to allied ships. Tactics through 45 rendered Kamikaze attacks far less effective against carriers then Japan hoped. But the effect these attacks had on morale shouldn't be understated. Allied soldiers were  often shocked, terrified and disgusted by the willingness of the Japanese solider to commit calculated suicide time and time again as opposed to surrender. It made many wonder how many men would have to die to take Japan itself. 
##
&gt;Tactics through 45 rendered Kamikaze attacks far less effective 

I'd love for you to elaborate on this if you have time.
##
I'm by no means an expert, but to my understanding increased concentrated air power around the carriers, using specific anti kamikaze/aircraft formations. Large improvements in anti-aircraft gun technology, radio frequency proximity fuzes and guns of large enough caliber and sufficient rates of fire to literally blow an aircraft out of the sky, given that an aircraft critically damaged on the right trajectory is nearly as effective as an untouched one. All played a big role in minimizing the potential damage the Kamikaze threat posed. 

And of course Japans rapidly deteriorating ability to wage any form of air war at all. 
##
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximity_fuze#Radio

&gt;As the shell approaches a reflecting object, an interference pattern is created. ...This signal is sent through a band pass filter, amplified, and triggers the detonation...

Wow that is amazing.  Almost 70 years ago too.
##
This is some orders or magnitude easier to implement  than the airborne radar systems available at the time. It's interesting Germany didn't put these on field as they had radio-controlled bombs and were experimenting with television guided ones.


##
"A Glorious Way To Die: The Kamikaze Mission of the Battleship Yamato" by Russell Spurr goes into air kamikaze tactics in some detail and is quite an enjoyable read.

Part of the problem was the poor training of the pilots.  Often, they would attack the first ship they saw instead of waiting for better targets.  This was typically a radar picket destroyer like *Bush* or *Calhoun*.  In some cases, the pilots may have confused destroyers with battleships.  They look similar if you don't know anything about ships.  Sometimes planes would miss the target at the last second, or be destroyed by flak.  Sometimes they'd fail at navigation and drown in the sea.

Air interception also got better.  The Fast Carrier Task Force could spot attacking kamikaze formations on radar miles away and send up the CAP.  A kamikaze flight is made up of slower, obsolete planes, whose pilots were barely qualified to fly in a straight line.  Easy prey for Hellcats during the day.  At night, the Task Force would simply put out to sea and hide.

Even with all these disadvantages, the kamikazes did manage to damage quite a few ships including the large fleet carrier *Franklin* which was put out of action with 989 casualties when a kamakaze dived out of the clouds.  The near-constant attacks were a huge strain on the men of the 7th fleet.  The Japanese failed to achieve the number of sinkings required by planners though.
##
My grandfather was on the Franklin, one of what I gathered to be only a few survivors. I don't think he ever talked about it to me, but my dad heard him talk about it once when he was drunk. Do you know how many crew were on the Franklin when it went down? is it 989 out of only a few thousand?
##
If it was the CV-13,  it had a crew around 3448

www.navsource.org/archives/02/13.htm‎

##
One big tactic was the development of the picket destroyer, sent far off from the carrier group to warm of incoming attacks. 
##
At that point, Japan lacked the time and fuel to train enough pilots to make any impact.  Their planes were outclassed by newer american models.    Convential attacks would have resulted in the annihilation of attacking squadrons, with little chance of damaging ships.   

It may have had a better chance of sinking ships, 
But victory was already impossible, so sacrificing many lives in such a manner was not worth anything.
##
Thanks that puts it into better context.

So it was essentially a futile, last-ditch attempt to do as much damage as possible?
##
Some leaders believed that they still might be able to get a negotiated peace if they made fighting on too bloody for the americans to bear.  They would use any weapon available, whether it be fighter planes with untrained pilots, or the battleship yamato and it's highly trained crew.  All were expected to do what they could, even if it meant suicidal tactics.
##
Any more info on the Yamato? I remember it being a high-priority target, but I can't remember why. Surely BB were easily countered by American air-power by the end of the war?
##
The [Battleship Yamat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Yamato)o was sent a suicide mission, basically the warship equivalent of a kamikaze mission.  It was supposed to go down to Okinawa, beach itself on the shore, and keep firing at the Americans until it was destroyed.

It was easily countered by American planes.  Sunk before it had a chance to get anywhere near the American fleet.
##
"A Glorious Way To Die: The Kamikaze Mission of the Battleship Yamato" by Russell Spurr is about this mission.  

During the battle of Okinawa, the Japanese mustered (IIRC) 3,500 kamikaze aircraft.  The Army promised to defend Okinawa to the last man.  The emperor asked "Where is the Navy?" and this is what sealed *Yamato's* fate.  Apparently he didn't understand how few ships were left, and no one had the heart to tell him.  

The plan was for *Yamato* and the cruiser *Yahagi* to sail to Okinawa with only enough fuel for a one-way trip, and beach themselves to serve as gun batteries.  The crew would then go ashore and serve as infantry.  To be frank, it was an incredibly ill-considered plan, but the Navy had to be seen as doing "something".

The plan relied on luck and surprise, but the Americans leaned of the sortie and even positioned a submarine at the Bungo Straits to radio the fleet when *Yamato* was on the way.  The submarine was under orders not to attack until it had radioed HQ, because HQ was concerned about the submarine being sunk before reporting.

Obviously *Yamato* and *Yahagi* never made it to Okinawa, sunk by planes of the Fast Carrier Task Force under Spruance and Mitscher.  Mitscher saw it as an opportunity to prove once and for all the superiority of air power over the battleship.  

*Yamato's* 18-inch guns were loaded with "beehive" shells which were supposed to wipe out an entire squadron in one shot.  But by this point in the war, US pilots had it down to a science.  US planes circled the Yamato just out of range, forming up.  Then, when everything was ready, they went in from every direction.  Fighters first, to strafe the gun crews clustered around the middle of the ship.  A real bloodbath.  Then came the dive bombers and torpedo bombers.  *Yamato* never had a chance.

A line of US battleships was also available to engage Yamato in a conventional battle if needed.
##
&gt;The plan relied on luck and surprise, but the Americans leaned of the sortie and even positioned a submarine at the Bungo Straits to radio the fleet when Yamato was on the way.

How did the Americans learn about the mission? Radio interception?
##
Probably scouting. It's not hard to miss the largest battleship ever made.
##
Following that line of thought, I've had discussions with numerous peoples on the usage of WMD's at the end of the war. In your opinion was that the US's version of making the fighting too bloody for the Japanese to continue, and thus generating unconditional surrender? 

##
I guess you could say that is how many wars are fought.

However, I don't think that the American goal of bombing was to simply kill as many Japanese people as possible until they gave up.  It was also meant to wreck Japan's economy and leave the country burdened with millions of unemployed and homeless people.

With unconditional surrender set as the goal, America needed to make Japan's leaders realize that there was absolutely no hope of obtaining a negotiated peace.  This was achieved through 1) atomic bombings and 2) Soviet entry into the war.   The first was a massively destructive new weapon that Japan had zero ability to stop and could cause the Americans to avoid a costly invasion.  The second killed Japan's diplomatic plans for a conditional surrender mediated via Moscow.
##
I may not be correct about this but I believe that the American Carriers had reinforced decks while the other allies did not
##
I think you have that one exactly backwards. I believe WW2 era US carriers didn't have armoured decks whilst British ones did.
##
Well you would probably be college educated and majored in some kind of Liberal Arts. 

“There was then a selection which, though it may seem monstrous, was quite logical: mathematics and science students were assigned to factories and research centers while law and liberal arts students were immediately placed in flight schools for training as suicide pilots.” -Millot, Bernard. Divine Thunder; the life and death of the kamikazes. pg 195

A lot of these pilots where very educated and spoken and read in multiple languages.


The Japanese did not resort to using the tactic of 'Kamikaze' until the war had essentially been lost. Training varied from person to person. This excerpt from a letter from someone who worked at a Kamikaze training facility to his son.

“At the hall where their farewell parties were held, the young student officers drank cold sake the night before their flight. Some gulped the sake in one swallow; others gulping down (a large amount). The whole place turned to mayhem. Some broke hanging light bulbs with their swords. Some lifted chairs to break the windows and tore white tablecloths. A mixture of military songs and curses filled the air. While some shouted in rage, others cried aloud. It was their last night of life. They thought of their parents, their faces and images, lovers’ faces and their smiles, a sad farewell to their fiancées- all went through their minds like a running horse lantern…Although they were supposedly ready to sacrifice their precious youth the next morning for imperial Japan and for the emperor, they were torn beyond what words can express- some putting their heads on the table, some writing their wills, some folding their hands in meditation, some leaving the hall, and some dancing in a frenzy while breaking flower vases. They all took off wearing the rising sun head band the next morning. But this scene of utter desperation has hardly been reported. I observed it with my own eyes, as I took care of their daily life, which consisted of incredibly strenuous training, coupled with cruel and torturous corporal punishment as a daily routine.” -Tierney, Emiko. Kamikaze diaries: reflections of Japanese student soldiers pg 10-11

I am afraid that some of the responses have been a little off in their accuracy about the normal background information on Kamikazes. If you would like me to go more in depth, provide more sources, have any question feel free to ask away.

##
What was to stop them from just flying away and starting a new life somewhere else?  Or running away from the training camp?
##
A couple things.
1. Japan is an island. If they ran away, they wouldn't get far before either civilians or the *Kempeitai* (military police) would get them.
2. Kamikaze pilots flew in old planes with limited fuel, and in formation with other pilots who would shoot them down if they tried anything.
 and most importantly
3. They were so indoctrinated with the thought that the Emperor was literally God on Earth, that they would do anything for him. In addition, Japan has a strong tradition of honor, and the thought of disgracing their family name would have stopped many from doing anything. Many even volunteered for kamikaze missions.
##
Military bases are high-security areas, for obvious reasons. A well-patrolled wall is difficult to cross unobserved in either direction.

As for just flying away, The kamikazes, like any other airborne unit, flew in groups. Abandoning the mission before reaching the enemy would be radioed home, leaving your family to shoulder your shame. Leaving once the battle started would be harder to notice, given that everyone is shooting at each other, but you still run most of the risk of being shot down.

Even if you escape, you're abandoning your squadmates to die in your place, not an easy decision to make. Your own chances of survival are low given that your plane is running on fumes (suicide planes were loaded with barely enough fuel to fly to the target, they weren't coming back), so you're going to be ditching in the middle of the ocean.
##
This is a follow-up question:

I remember being told in school that many of those pilots were actually Koreans, and that they were doing it to help their families back home. Is that true?
##
Not many, but some were Koreans.

http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2008/05/10/news/opponents-try-to-block-memorial-for-korean-kamikaze/


##
I think it is important to note that many regular military personnel also went on Kamikaze attacks as well.  For instance, Admiral Ugaki, Yamamoto's chief of staff, despite being critically wounded when Yamamoto's plane was shot down, recovered so that he could lead a kamikaze plane attack on the last day of the war.  

Tameichi Hara, one of the few Japanese destroyer commanders to survive the war, had a very unusual outlook on Kamikaze missions.  He had been raised on the idea that the Japanese samurai spirit was based off the idea that a samurai should be prepared to die, he should not die easily.  Thus to him, the idea that soldiers were told to commit suicide was repulsive.  When he was assigned to a torpedo boat school, he received news that he was supposed to offer a "course" on the use of suicide torpedo boats, as well as one on becoming a frogman.  He was so disturbed by this idea that he went off to file a petition to the Emperor asking him to seek peace and fire all generals and admirals.  In a society that has as much social pressure as Japan, this was almost high treason.

Yet, even someone as repulsed by the idea of suicide as he was could not help but go on a suicide mission when he was called upon,  He was assigned to the cruiser Yahagi for the battleship Yamato's suicidal sortie, and still obeyed the order to do so, despite every single captain protesting the mission as a waste of resources, ships, and lives.  He mentioned that the "kamikaze spirit" was really strong that day.  

So off he went, where the Yamato and most of the remaining operational ships of the IJN were slaughtered by American aircraft.  He was one of the few survivors of his ship.  Before he was rescued, though, he had an interesting viewpoint of what it was like when he thought he was going to die on his kamikaze mission:

An American floatplane came by and picked up a nearby downed pilot.  He felt jealousy that the pilot was able to be rescued like that.  
The sailors in the water, despite it being against training, started to sing to lift their spirits.
He thought himself an idiot for failing his subordinates and for abandoning his family.
He tied himself to a log, so that even if he died, his body may wash back onto the Japanese isles.

Nobody wanted to die, nor did they want their comrades to die.  The "Bushido" that many people cite as being the main cause of kamikaze attacks really didn't have as big of a factor as the sheer peer pressure that many young men felt at the time.

The Taiwanese documentary [Go Grandriders](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2567390/) touches slightly on the experiences of some of the veterans during the Japanese colonial period, invasion of China, and WWII, including discussion of how one of them used to train Kamikaze pilots. Might be worth checking out, or seeing if you can at least find those scenes somewhere.
