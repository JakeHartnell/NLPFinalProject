Back when the history channel aired shows about actual history, there was a show called [The Last Days of WWII](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1545455/), which covered the final months of the war week by week in a series of about 35 one hour episodes. The episode that covers the week of Hitlers suicide spent a good deal of time discussing what motivated his decision to off himself. According to that episode, the two biggest things on his mind were the mob justice that Mussolini endured and the nature of Stalins plans for him. Hitler knew that Stalin wanted him alive (which matches the orders Stalin gave his troops) and he knew of Stalins infamous cruelty. By then Russia had allready went through many of its infamous purges, so it was well known that Stalin was not exactly a fan of fair and legal trials. If Stalin had Hitler alive (and remember it was the Red Army that took Berlin) he would have used Hitler as a propaganda tool in one way or another. The soviet population hated Hitler in a way that it is diffifcult for someone who hasnt endured what they endured to understand. In the episode I mentioned, one of the historians speculated that Stalin may have brought Hitler back in a cage for the victory parade at Red Square. While that is a hypothetical scenerio, you can be certain Hitler would have experienced a great deal of degradation and probably a great deal of torture before his eventual show trial and execution. The way the Red Army conducted itself in Germany shows how blood hungry the Russian people were and Stalins conduct as the leader of Russia shows how ruthless he was. The combination would not have been good for Hitler.

How did The Red Army conduct itself in Germany exactly?


##
Mass rapes, summary executions, torture, mutilation. Looting and pillaging. The officer corps largely turned a blind eye to it (or actively participated). Those who *did* speak out were often silenced, and official reports ignored or fudged. Soviet propaganda had been painting Germans as beasts and urging its soldiers on to gorge themselves in violence against the enemy for months, perhaps without thinking through the inevitable consequences. Revenge was a particularly ubiquitous theme throughout the propaganda posters:

* ["Open fire on murderers of our wives and children!"](http://imgur.com/fSOtHHO)

* ["Revenge!"](http://imgur.com/19Rwwod)

* ["Revenge for the people's misery!"](http://imgur.com/VMHcVpI)

Soldiers were encouraged from on high to personally commit acts of revenge for every crime they had witnessed (or heard about) from the Germans. Command wanted to instil *hatred* into the conscript army as a primary motivator. And it worked; the Red Army was practically frothing at the mouth by the time it entered East Prussia. It succeeded to the point where command had to start backpedalling and trying (with varying degrees of success) to rein in the troops, as the regular atrocities were starting to seriously impact discipline.

Some quotes from historians on how bad things were at the *start*.

* Max Hastings, *Armageddon: The Battle for Germany*:

&gt; [Five days after the capture of Nemmersdorf], hardly one civilian inhabitant survived. Women had been nailed to barn doors and farm carts, or been crushed by tanks after being raped. Their children had been killed. Forty French prisoners of war working on on local farms had been shot, likewise avowed German communists. The Red Army's behaviour reflected not casual brutality, but systematic sadism rivalling that of the Nazis.

* Richard Overy, *Russia's War*:

&gt; "In the first villages they occupied in October 1944 the soldiers slaughtered the population, raping and torturing the women, old and young. Refugees were shelled and bombed and crushed beneath the tracks of advancing tanks."

Things got worse from there.

Officially, rape was a capital crime if a soldier was caught at it. In practice, it was ignored. Men and women who tried to save their children or families from being gang-raped in front of them were killed or mutilated, and then the children were shot or, in the worst cases, left crucified against a wall or door when the troops moved on. When Stalin was informed of the behaviour of the soldiers he shrugged, saying: 

&gt; "Imagine a man who has fought over thousands of kilometres of his own devastated land, across the dead bodies of his comrades and dearest ones? What is so awful in his *having fun* with a woman, after such horrors? The Red Army is not ideal, nor can it be. The important thing is that it fights Germans."

The Soviets had ample cause for revanchism. Over the past few years they had lost, at a low estimate, twenty million people. **Twenty million**. Those who had fought and lived had survived against a foe who would offer them no quarter, who were reported to have committed atrocities against mass numbers of civilians. And these reports were starting to be borne out as the first of the death camps were being liberated. It seemed to the Red Army that the propaganda was almost *downplaying* what the Nazis were. The Germans were, in their eyes, monsters - civilians and soldiers alike.

What's more, they were monsters who did not seem to have had any need to invade Russia in the first place. Houses in the German heartlands were filled with foods and goods that the Communist peasant soldier had never seen even *before* the outbreak of war, let alone what they had been living on for the past few years. I read a fairly amusing anecdote a while back about a unit who stumbled across a cache of a mysteriously oily white substance. The commander guesses that it might be lubricant for farm machinery. After two days, a private works up the nerve to try eating some of it, praying silently that it's not poison (or just poisoned). When he wakes up the next day, he goes to the commander and says "I think I've heard about this stuff - it's called 'margarine'." Whereupon the whole unit feasts on pancakes. My point is that it would be one thing if the Germans were desperate and looking for "Russian riches". But these people were, comparatively speaking, living in the lap of luxury before they began slaughtering everyone to the east of them. When the Red Army discovered the truth of this for themselves, it just added more fuel to the fires of envy and rage.

The German forces also inadvertently made it worse for the civilian population by leaving behind large untouched caches of hard liquor. The thought was that a drunk soldier is a soldier easily killed. Unfortunately, an angry drunk soldier is all the more likely to join in the gang rape of the wives and daughters of the men who had invaded and killed their own families. 

The Russians were also constantly exhorted to be on the look out for partisans, irregular troops who might attack the supply lines once the front moved past them. Which made for a handy excuse when looking to kill whoever they wanted to. And it was an excuse they often fell back upon, especially after the first of the death camps were liberated and it became clear just what had been going on even in the German homeland.

I don't want to downplay the fact that everything the Soviets did to Germany had already been done ten-fold by Germans in Russia. And the people "returning the favour" were not the same troops who had started the war. Those were, by and large, already dead. By the time the Red Army arrived in Germany, a sizable portion of it was made up of violent prisoners released as an emergency measure, or prisoners of war who had felt brutality at the hands of the Germans themselves, or foreigners "recruited" at gunpoint with no reason to reflect well upon their unit and with resentment against both sides. But, regardless of any excuses or mitigating circumstances, it was still a horrific sequence of events.
##
How did the Russians treat the people they liberated from concentration camps or POW camps?
##
In the case of former Red Army soldiers found in German PoW camps, it depended on how you had ended up there. If you were captured while unconscious or badly wounded, you were put back into the army or sent back home, depending on the severity of your injuries. If you had surrendered, you were shot or, if the officer in charge were feeling lenient, sent to a Gulag for a few years. This wasn't so much to punish the PoWs as it was to discourage desertion and surrender in the rest of the army. Once the tide began to turn and increasingly large numbers of captured soldiers were recovered they did start to lighten up on punishments. 

Anyone who had collaborated with the prison officers, or who had accepted any form of rank or responsibility over their fellow prisoners, was shot regardless of the circumstances of their capture. If you were a partisan you were generally shot or imprisoned too, no matter who you claim you were fighting for. Polish irregulars in particular did not fare very well after being "liberated". Soldiers from regular armies of other Allied powers were sent back West when it was possible, though they were (fairly politely) interrogated first.

Concentration camp survivors were treated relatively well - provided that they weren't in there for reasons that the Soviets agreed with. Survivors were fantastic for propaganda purposes. In fact, even the dead were put to use. Several thousand Jewish corpses were disinterred and propped up along the roads into Germany with notices decrying how the Germans had mistreated these "Soviet citizens".
##
Soldiers from regular armies of other Allied powers were sent back West when it was possible, though they were (fairly politely) interrogated first.&gt; 

This is interesting, are there any first hand accounts of this from freed POW's? Were they all treated the same if they were from the West, or were Americans treated different then Brits, etc?
##
It depends. Near the end of the war the Soviets kept a hold of Western POWs so that they could perform exchanges with the Allied powers for other political prisoners. Unfortunately, in many cases these political prisoners from the USSR were also political refugees, and the Soviets didn't even wait until Allies were out of earshot to liquidate Stalin's political opponents.
##
So they were used as a bargaining chip to get anyone who opposed Stalin and left for refuge? (I don't know why I needed to reiterate that hah). Other than refugees did the Allies somehow end up with Soviet POW's? Or the equivalent of finding German held Soviet POV's liberated from camps?
##
I have seen conflicting reports, so I cannot reasonably say. It was shocking to me, but in hindsight only because the United States federal government has historically actively covered up Soviet atrocities and war crimes for diplomatic and political purposes.
##
I think it's worth pointing out that in the Soviet Union/the countries that made it up, the Holocaust is not nearly as big a deal as it is in the West.  

This is likely partially because of animus towards Jews (which sure as hell exists/existed) or because in a lot of places, the locals were happy to cooperate with the extermination of the local Jewry.  But it is in large part because there was so much incredible and unthinkable suffering in Eastern Europe during World War II that the Holocaust was not considered a huge deviation from what everyone else endured (although in my opinion, it sure as hell was).  That, and the Soviets didn't want to recognise the particular suffering of one group because they didn't want to make anyone look special.

If you visit the site of the massacre at Babi Yar in/on the outskirts of Kiev (where the Nazis basically rounded up all the Jews of Kiev, executed them, and threw their bodies into the ravine), the main memorial (the official one put up by the Soviets) makes no mention of the fact that the massacre was an act of genocide.  It simply memorialises the thousands of 'Soviet citizens' killed at the site.

That being said, there is a separate monument elsewhere (behind what looked like a TV station when I visited) which commemorates the fact that the massacre at Babi Yar was a wholesale slaughter of Jews.  It was erected by a Jewish organisation.

Note: this is based upon what I've learned from classes at university and from my travels to Eastern Europe.  If my claims are incorrect or ill-informed, I would be happy to be corrected.
##
This is an interesting point.  Up to 1.5 million people died as a result of Germany and Finland's Blockade of Leningrad alone.  Famine and starvation, hypothermia.  A lot of people caved in to cannibalism in order to survive.

A former professor of mine has dedicated his research career to interviewing survivors and documenting personal stories from this event.  He told me that once, the Holocaust was mentioned in an interview, and the survivor became very upset.  She said "Holocaust?  We lost a million people in one city.  We have our own Holocaust."

&gt; provided that they weren't in there for reasons that the Soviets agreed with.

What sorts of reasons were reasons that the Soviets agreed with?
##
The responses varied, but were seldom good.


If you were in a German internment camp, and were "liberated" by the soviets, hopefully you weren't a soldier.


Soviet soldiers that were recaptured typically got executed or sent off to the gulag unless they were seriously wounded when captured. *Hopefully* they could prove it. If someone said / could prove you collaborated with the Germans while in camp, you were equally screwed. 


If you were from another allied nation, you were *typically* interrogated and let loose. The Soviets certainly wanted to squeeze anything useful from their allies, but they didn't want to agitate a response- if the western allies had the PR positioning to justify it, they could have chased the Soviets all the way back to their pre-war borders. God knows Patton railed against the idea of making peace with them.


If you were *remotely* nationalist, you were generally screwed. When the Soviets ran through what would become warsaw block countries they had no interest in letting folks who treasured the concept of an independent state enough to fight as they did *back* into the countries. This was especially true of Poland. Its pure speculation, but me thinks this is rooted in Russia's and Poland's collective history. 



If you were one of the poor Germans who happened to *run* the camps, well shit. 
##
&gt; a sizable portion of it was made up of violent prisoners released as an emergency measure, or prisoners of war who had felt brutality at the hands of the Germans themselves, or foreigners "recruited" at gunpoint with no reason to reflect well upon their unit and with resentment against both sides

I've always heard of the Germans recruiting old men and young boys towards the end, but never thought about the Russian equivalent. Could someone point me towards more reading or possibly (hopefully) elaborate? I've always had a weird love for WWII era history, and reading comments from passionate redditors seems more engaging than going through random historical webpages.
##
Ah! I've actually read about this!

Yes, there were indeed substantial numbers of men released from gulags to serve at the front.  Many of these men were straight-up criminals; thieves, murderers, rapists, etc.  And at the end of the war, when they returned to Soviet society, they either were not inclined to or were unable to contain themselves.  So back to prison/the gulag they went.

There was a bitter tradition dating back to Tsarist times in Russian prison colonies of total non-cooperation with prison officials or the government.  Don't snitch, don't help, don't even comply with the guards.

Now, you can imagine that the reunion of the collaborators and the non-collaborators went.

The collaborators were labelled 'Суки' or 'bitches' (with an even stronger connotation in Russian), and were treated by other prisoners like scum.  They were the lowest of the low, and relied on special treatment from the guards (which made them even more despicable), won through further cooperation and collaboration.

What resulted was the phenomenon known as the ' Сучьи войны' or 'Bitch-wars,' which involved wide-spread and serious violence against the 'bitches.'

Great amount of info here! Just to add one thing though, out of concern that the Red Army have been painted as some kind of phenomenal evil. I wanted to point out that a clear difference was noted between the first and sceond waves of Russian troops. According to both "the world at war" and Anthony Beevor's "Berlin: The Downfall", citizens of Berlin recount how the first wave of Russian soldiers were very buisness-like and civil. It was the second wave of troops that'd pass through, often already drunk, here is where the bulk of what you're describing was commited. There were frequent stories of kindness from Russian frontline troops (some of whom were also women) towards civilians. The horrors you've spoken of are true, I just really worry that since the second world war a lot was done to demonise the Russians (and still is, if it ain't Arabs being the villians in films or games it's Russians) so I wanted to add a tiny bit more context.
##
This is actually really interesting, and I think it's accurate because the best fighting units tend to be the most professional. When you invade a country, you put your best troops in first. Those troops are well-equipped, disciplined, and well-trained. With the right weapons, they can destroy a much larger force.

Occupation troops, on the other hand, don't have to be well trained. As long as they can hold a rifle, they can occupy a city. You just need numbers. So, the Soviets probably drafted a bunch of guys, gave them guns, and said, "Here's a bunch of people to supervise. Make sure they don't do anything."

Needless to say, that's not a good plan if you want those people to be safe.
##
I've read in the past Russians claiming that most of the rapes were committed by non-russian ethnicities from the Soviet Union.  Is there much truth to this,  or is it more revisionist to deflect blame. 
##
http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/pyhalov/31027164/76004/76004_original.jpg

This table shows percentage of different etnicities in Red Army. It's in Russian, but it's easy to understand. Columns show dates, rightmost is census data for all populace. Etnicities (rows) are:

Russians, Ukranians, Belarusians, Armenians, Georgians, Azerbaijanians, Izbeks, Tajiks, Kazakh etc.

You can see that at the end of war there was roughly 83% of Slavs in the army, while other etnicities (I imagine those Russians blames Caucasians) get something like 1.5-2% each. It doesn't look like there were enough of them to do significant damage without, ahem, noble Slavs stopping them.
##
Fantastic response, but I just have a few followup questions regarding the topic of rape in particular. Do you have an estimate on how many instances of rape and how many women were raped during the Russian invasion?

Did Allied soldiers (non-Red Army) ever rape as much as the Russians did if they did at all (and if so was it the Germans or also perhaps when liberating France, etc)?

Are there any autobiographical accounts of the German women who were raped or bystanders of the rapes? I am aware of Marta Hillers' "A woman in Berlin" but I am unable to find anything else.
##
Germans saw the french and british as equals (nazi propaganda explicitly saw Slavic peoples as sub-human). The western front was really quite civil* (towards POW's and civilians) compared to the eastern and pacific theatres.
##
There are a lot of interesting things about how different the Nazis could be in different countries. I am Norwegian and at our war museums you can read e.g. the german instruction book about how to approach Norwegians. It stated specifically that they should try to be nice because we were of the same "stock" as they said. It even said that they should refrain from screaming to Norwegians because they really dislike that :-)

Still and occupation is an occupation. The Nazis were almost universally hated, despite Norwegian occupation being quite mild in relative terms. There was no mass rapes or executions. But the Germans could be quite brutal when they started more actively sabotaging German operations. There would be sporadic killing of civilians as revenge. But they were also trying hard to be not too excessively bad, because they wanted Norwegians on their side. I guess it was the dream of a great Aryan nation.

Denmark har an even milder occupation since they chose cooperation with the Germans from the start. In exchange for cooperation they were allowed to mostly keep their political system. They had regular elections during occupation as far as I understand. That is the reason why the Danes managed to save all their jews from the concentration camps. The Germans did not want to jeopordize their good relationship with the Danes over the Jews, so they purposefully did a really poor job at going after Danes who saved Jews. But towards the end it got worse since danish resistance forces went on a killing spree, executing nazi collaborators.
##
Yes Denmark came to the conclusion that violent resistance was bad since the Nazis would always kill more civilians for every dead Nazi.  Interestingly the Danes were also one of the most successful in getting the Jews out if the country.  They rallied up an enormous population of Jews and at risk of themselves they took them in little boats across the border.  Granted a few expected payment for the ride or to be on the first boat, most acted out if the kindness of their heart to save their Jewish countrymen.
##
The main reason denmark chose to collaborate was because doing otherwise would be practically suicude, as there was no way denmark could have held off the germans for long, even with the islands.
##
While the scale of the war was much larger on the Eastern front, the ferocity and casualties per unit area often matched the worst of the Eastern Front at times, like at various stages of the Normandy campaign (especially the Falaise Pocket), and at the Battle of the Bulge. Civil may be a bit misleading, because the warfare could be just as brutal.

I do know what you mean, though. Prisoners were (usually) treated with respect by both sides, and civilians mostly escaped the intentional sort of horror inflicted on the Eastern Front.
##
Although certain SS divisions are known ti have committed war crimes on the western front
##
Based on German hospital and abortion clinic records, it's estimated that roughly two million German women were raped by Soviet troops during the invasion. There are issues with those estimates that affect it in both directions. Clinics were initially only allowed to perform abortions in cases of rape, incest, or medical emergency;  there were doubtless cases of desperate women who made a plausible claim of rape to receive treatment. On the other hand, it's difficult to pin down exact numbers for Soviet atrocities when so many of the women were killed by the soldiers immediately afterwards during the initial push into Germany. The numbers also include rapes carried out by Soviet troops during the immediate post-war period, while they were still stationed in significant numbers throughout the country.

Rapes on the Western Front were isolated incidents, totalling up to some 15-25,000. The Americans were the most up-front about punishing offenders, while the British and French struggled at times to keep the troops in line, particularly after they had been drinking. It's something that is always going to happen on some scale during war, but it was not endemic as it was in the East.

I'm afraid I can't point offhand to autobiographical accounts from German women relating to the issue of rape during this period beyond Hiller's book, which you've already mentione.
##
&gt; The Americans were the most up-front about punishing offenders,

I read some where that it was mostly the black soldiers who received discipline when they raped, including shot on sight, but turned a blind eye for white soldiers, is it true?
##
I think this is incorrect, but only because there's a much better explanation - black soldiers served in segregated regiments and mostly did headquarters duty. They were orderlies, construction workers, cooks, etc.

When you're in a headquarters unit, your activity is placed under a bigger microscope. Even regular shenanigans are dealt with harshly because the command doesn't have anything better to do. So, black soldiers happened to be in areas with lots of civilians and under the eye of a vigilant command. Put some racism on top of that, (watch those black soldiers, they'll get into trouble) and you get skewed statistics.

Out in the field, they were happy to overlook things as long as the war was being won. Imagine trying to court-martial your best sergeant when the Germans are right in front of you and you're missing your best NCO. That's like a coach suspending his quarterback right before the playoffs. And just like a high school covers up for their jocks, the military did (and still does, to some extent) cover up for people doing horrible things because they didn't want to have to deal with the fallout of replacing them.
##
Do you know if there are any sources describing rapes of men by the Red Army? I figure that if there were 2 million rapes of women there should also have been a notable number of men that were raped. 
##
Where are the sources on the UK/FR and US soldiers? I heard the opposite.
##
In 2010, physics professor Gabriele Köpp who was 15 at the end of WW2 published a book that was credited as the first extensive memoir by a German woman about her rape experiences after the war.[Here](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/harrowing-memoir-german-woman-writes-ground-breaking-account-of-ww2-rape-a-680354.html)'s an English article about it.
##
&gt; the first extensive memoir by a German woman about her rape experiences after the war.

This is not true as such, the anonymously authored "A Woman in Berlin" - [Wikipedia link] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Woman_in_Berlin) - deals with the personal experience of a German woman who was a repeated victim of rape by Red Army soldiers. It was published in 1954. 

##
the russians also helped in taking parts of Norway back, but they did not steal, rape or murder anyone there and i wonder why?
##
Probably because the Norwegians had been victims of the Nazis, just like themselves.
##
but then what about the polish? if i remember correctly so did they atleast do some form of damage to the polish people
##
The Poles hadn't been on friendly terms with German or Russian states for a long time. Dating back to tsarist Russia and in the days when Prussia still existed, Poland (in a Commonwealth with Lithuania), a large but weak state, was constantly shoved around by its more powerful neighbors. It was partitioned three times, eventually disappearing off of the map of Europe. From then on there would be numerous insurrections, none of them successful. The Polish people were stateless from 1795-1918 (except for Napoleon's Grand Duchy of Warsaw).

When the new state was formed after World War I, it was done so at significant territorial cost to Germany (and the Soviet Union via the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk). As a result, both nations felt like the Polish lands were theirs, since they had held it for over a century. Neither had any love lost for the Poles, which had represented a constant thorn in their sides with their independence movements and all that. This is why the two powers so quickly agreed to split Poland, and there was no love lost for the Polish people on either side.

Yes, the Soviets were responsible for atrocities in Poland as well. During the reconquest, the Soviets fully expected to retain Poland after the war, at least in the form of a satellite state, and allowed the Germans to crush the Warsaw Uprising in order to weaken the Polish before liberation. They were also responsible for the Katyn massacre of surrendered Polish army officers before the war began (for the Soviets).
##
the katyn massacre is horrifying in it's own right. 22,000 prisoners of war from the officer corp and high ranking civilians who surrendered peacfully to the soviets when poland was invaded, murdered simply so there would be less resistance to soviet rule

&gt;Detailed information on the executions in the Kalinin NKVD prison was provided during a hearing by Dmitrii Tokarev, former head of the Board of the District NKVD in Kalinin. According to Tokarev, the shooting started in the evening and ended at dawn. The first transport on 4 April 1940, carried 390 people, and the executioners had a hard time killing so many people during one night. The following transports held no more than 250 people. The executions were usually performed with German-made 7.65×17mm Walther PPK pistols supplied by Moscow, but 7.62×38mmR Nagant M1895 revolvers were also used.[31] The executioners used German weapons rather than the standard Soviet revolvers, as the latter were said to offer too much recoil, which made shooting painful after the first dozen executions.[32] Vasili Mikhailovich Blokhin, chief executioner for the NKVD—and quite possibly the most prolific executioner in history—is reported to have personally shot and killed 7,000 of the condemned, some as young as 18, from the Ostashkov camp at Kalinin prison over a period of 28 days in April 1940.[28][33]

&gt;The killings were methodical. After the personal information of the condemned was checked, he was handcuffed and led to a cell insulated with stacks of sandbags along the walls and a felt-lined, heavy door. The victim was told to kneel in the middle of the cell, was then approached from behind by the executioner and immediately shot in the back of the head. The body was carried out through the opposite door and laid in one of the five or six waiting trucks, whereupon the next condemned was taken inside. In addition to muffling by the rough insulation in the execution cell, the pistol gunshots were also masked by the operation of loud machines (perhaps fans) throughout the night. This procedure went on every night, except for the May Day holiday.[34]

but what happened with the discovery of the katyn burial site is a lesson in how screwed up the world was at that time. when the germans found the massacre site, they used it as propaganda material against the russians

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e6/Les_mrtvych_v_Katyne.jpg

when the russians retook the area, they planted evidence and said the germans committed the massacre

the whole era was colossal race to the bottom: who can kill the most people, in the most brutal fashion, and claim their enemy killed more, in a more brutal fashion. a sort of anti-morality. it really makes you wonder, how humanity can be that screwed up

&gt;When, in September 1943, Goebbels was informed that the German army had to withdraw from the Katyn area, he wrote a prediction in his diary. His entry for 29 September 1943 reads: "Unfortunately we have had to give up Katyn. The Bolsheviks undoubtedly will soon 'find' that we shot 12,000 Polish officers. That episode is one that is going to cause us quite a little trouble in the future. The Soviets are undoubtedly going to make it their business to discover as many mass graves as possible and then blame it on us".[46]

&gt;Having retaken the Katyn area almost immediately after the Red Army had recaptured Smolensk, around September–October 1943, NKVD forces began a cover-up operation.[23][53] A cemetery the Germans had permitted the Polish Red Cross to build was destroyed and other evidence removed.[23] Witnesses were "interviewed", and threatened with being arrested as German collaborators if their testimonies disagreed with the official line.[53][54] Since none of the documents found on the dead had dates later than April 1940 the Soviet secret police planted false evidence that pushed the massacre date forward to the summer of 1941 when the Nazis controlled the area.[54] A preliminary report was issued by NKVD operatives Vsevolod Merkulov and Sergei Kruglov, dated 10–11 January 1944, concluding that the Polish officers were shot by the Germans.[53]

##
What was the reason for killing the poles? Seems like a lot of work for the Russians. 
##
Soviet Russia started the second world war on Nazi side by attacking Poland on the 17th of September 1939. Few days before that they signed the non-aggresion treaty with Nazi Germany (think about it a non aggresion treaty signed at a sime when they did not had a common border).
They divided Poland and and soon the Soviets too started their [rule of terror](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_Poland_\(1939%E2%80%931945\)#Treatment_of_Polish_citizens_under_Soviet_occupation).

When Soviet Russia was attacked by Nazi Germany in 1941 they "became aalies" in a way that Germany was now a common enemy. But Poland and Poles were lost at that time. When attacking Germany Soviet armies marched through Poland and pretty much finished what they started in 1939 (last soviet troops left Poland in 1990). NKVD was looking for memberf of intelligence, non comunist partisans (members of Home Army) and other "enemy elements" Last Polish partisans fought the new comunist Polish goverment  up to 1956
##
Why is the poster not in German then?
##
It was almost certainly directed at Slovaks, judging by the ŕ.
##
5 million polish died. Wikipedia says 2 million of that was in the Russian part (which was also occupied by the nazis). 
##
Do these numbers include the Jewish Poles, or are they separate?
##
It was around 3 million Polish Jews and 2.5 million Poles.
##
Surely the second number has to be larger than the first?
##
The Germans carried out a vicious scorched earth policy in Finnmark and Northern Troms. All houses were to be burned, all people to be evacuated and everything useful to the soviets to be destroyed. Some stayed behind, living in caves, lavvu's and other primitive forms of shelter in the mountains during the winter, including my grandfather who was eventually discovered and put in a prison camp until the German capitulation.

In addition to not having anyone to rape or murder, or anything but ruins and rubble to steal, the Soviets were joined by a very small Norwegian force, making it undiplomatic to the extreme to kill, rape and murder Norwegians, especially Norwegians living in the poorest part of Norway. 

Northern Norway was not well developed, we didn't have a road network to speak until the Germans occupied Norway and used Russian POW's to build it, most people lived as fishermen, fishermen-farmers and in the case of my grandfather hunter-lumberjack-fisherman-farmer. 

There is the case of the Sami people, who the Germans probably didn't evacuate many of, since they lived a nomadic/semi nomadic lifestyle. However the Sami didn't really have much of valuables. I don't know if any incidents happened with them, but my guess would be no.

As Hitler was ramping up for Operation Barbarossa, he gave what is known as the ["Commissar Directive"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissar_Order) to his troops.  It was basically a green light to commit war crimes against the Russian army and the civilians suffered as a result.
##
The "Commissar Order" became quite a big deal during the Nuremberg trial. Determining who passed it on and who ignored it consumed quite a bit of time.
##
Didn't the Soviets have a similar(Commissar Order) policy towards the SS? It's my understanding that the SS felt that they would be shot outright by the Soviets, whether that was a written policy or not. Is that accurate?

Edit: Am I getting downvoted for just asking a reasonable question? Why?
##
The western allies did the same in regards of SS-members, a particular battle i can remember from the back of my head is the battle of carpiquet airfield in normandy, it was hold by SS and fallschirmsjaegers supported by 88's, the attackers were the canadian forces
##
It is good to mention Solzhenitsyn's narrative poem ["Prussian Nights"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_Nights) based on his experiences as a young officer about the last stages of the war. He was arrested for critiquing the treatment of civilians by the Russian troops (the rapes and the murders).
##
Can you recommend some solid reading on this matter?

From what I experienced (in Russia), russian atrocities started being proclaimed in yet another wave of late (post-soviet) anti-soviet propaganda. Rape victims counting (and it's all about counting, because there were too many people involved to exclude some cases of any possible crime) in abortion clinics is very uncertain (because "russian raped me" is too good an excuse to not be used), and Martin Hillers worked as Nazi propagandist, so her (anonymous!) voice is to be doubted.

I am biased, so, sorry that it's not "tell me", but "prove me". And as I am not a historian, I'm asking for sources to avoid lame reasoning from my side.
##
You're right that it's important to take the words of dissidents such as Kopelev and Solzhenitsyn with a grain of salt - they had an axe to grind for their imprisonment. On the other hand, both were locked away for complaining about the problem in the first place.

I went for Hastings as he's a punchy writer to quote from, but he is admittedly drawn to making controversial statements. For a slightly more authoritative approach, Antony Beevor's *Fall of Berlin* goes into some detail on the final days of the war and the conduct of the Soviet troops during that period. If you want a general picture on the German contributions to the atrocity competition, which are easily comparable in scale, his book *Stalingrad* is also quite readable and in depth.

I do back up [the AskHistorian wiki's recommendation](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/books/wwii#wiki_europe) of Catherine Merridale's *Ivan's War*, but with a grain of salt. Her coverage is patchy and ignores several branches of the Red Army altogether. Nonetheless, even as a social historian with an interest in rehabilitating the image of the average Soviet soldier, she still includes many accounts from the veterans themselves in which they casually discuss the widespread campaign of rapes and retributive violence against the German civilian population.
##
I'll try to find/read "Ivan's War" just in case.

I see there is almost ongoing dispute with Beevor specifically on this matter. And looking a little deeper, I found that it's well known case.

What I see as a link (in Beevor's book, I just looked up) for 2000000 rapes seems to refer to even more controversial source: Helke Sander.

If I understand correctly (what Helke Sander used in 1992), 2000000 is the result of playing with numbers 12, 237, 20 and 567 (12 out of 237 children allegedly had russian fathers in 1945 and 20 out of 567 in 1946, in one clinic), ignoring even the number of alleged rapers among the fathers of those 32 children (rape cases were separated, but estimates assumed russian ergo rape).
If that's the "proof" (I did not read the original, I found [well, internet] arguments in russian against "BeFreier und BeFreite" statistics; I can give a link to them if you want) of 2000000 Beevor refers to, then it's to be ignored completely, as numbers have to be treated with more respect.

Viewing GARF sources Beevor claims to have used (retaliating russian official outrage against his book) seems to be weird, because he does not base atrocities scope (in "Vae Victis!") on official archives (there are references, but they have nothing to do with 2000000 or something).

I am interested because it's like*: my grandfathers die, and soon some people start claiming that they probably raped some women (which are dead too), because mothers of 32 out of 804 children in one clinic claimed that fathers were russian.
*like: they both fought and survived (that's a prerequisite for having offspring), I do not remember about the other, but one definitely did not enter Germany.
##
&gt; The officer corps largely turned a blind eye to it (or actively participated). Those who did speak out were often silenced . . . 

When you say "silenced" do you mean told to be quiet, reassigned, or killed?


##
They were arrested, generally. When Lev Kopalev became disillusioned in his work at the propaganda office covering up atrocities and spoke out about them, he was sentenced to a ten-year term in the Gulag for fostering "bourgeois humanism" and for "compassion towards the enemy".  Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, an artillery commander, was arrested and sentenced to eight years of hard labour for noting what was going on in letters to a friend back home.
##
Interesting note: letters were very serious business. In theory you could even be arrested for a private diary, but as far as I know it was generally overlooked as many such diaries exist.
##
Solzhenitsyn was arrested for complaining about the treatment of civilians by the red army. This is discussed by Robert Conquest in his translation of Solzhenitsyn's narrative poem, "Prussian Nights".
##
How many units were made up of "freed" prisoners? Even just a relative scale a lot to a little. 
Were these treated like the conscripts in Stalingrad, were they were forced to fight or be slaughtered upon retreating, or were the officers' conduct more free, due to the rapid progression and successes they began facing?
I think of myself as pretty knowledgeable concerning WWII, but had not ran into this information. Thanks
##
I can't give you specific source (heard it in some Russian historical talkshow) but it was something like that: most of the freed people, 90% or something were sent back to army in the reserve (not to the front) after some background check. The check was basically getting details about surrendering and asking around. If anything suspicious is found (other prisoners said he worked as a supervisor, or he lied about his original unit) than it's getting complicated. For all Red Army knows, the guy may have helped murdering other prisoners or - in some cases - wasn't really a prisoner, worked with Germans (as a local policeman, f.e.) and tries to blend with prisoners. In some cases prisoner broke free from the camp, which was even more problematic, cause it's hard to be sure he's not a spy. In the end something like a couple of percents were found guilty for sure, that meant GULAG. Others were sent to penal batallions, were they had to fight on front in the hottest spots for several month.

Edit: ah, there are sources: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_crimes_against_Soviet_POWs#Soviet_reprisals_against_former_POWs
##
It wasn't just rumor: on their way into Russia the German army had also raped, murdered and pillaged, leaving burnt out villages behind with the dead in the streets. As the Red Army chased the Germans back into Germany they traveled through these areas and saw first hand what the Germans had done. The German army treated eastern Europeans much differently from the west.
##
Oh god here we go again with this bs. My uncles were fighting in Poland and Germany, so I know first hand.
##
Around 380,000(Germany claims 1 million.) German POW died in Soviet custody. 

Towards the end of the war German troops started heading towards Allied locations to surrender or be captured because of the fear of being caught by the soviets.


91,000 German troops were captured after Stalingrad, only around 6,000 survived long enough to be freed after the end of the war.

The Soviets didn't even treat their own troops very well, let alone a German POW. For a German soldier, being caught by the soviets would likely be a more scary thought then actually being killed in battle. 
##
And while German POW's on the western front were mostly released shortly after the end of the war, the soviets were in no rush when it came to liberating its free labour, with some living in work camps 'till the mid 50's. A famous example is the top scoring ace [Erich Hartmann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Hartmann) who was kept in work camps on made-up war-crime charges.
##
They used some of the German camps, and according to German communists that were imprisoned there, and later imprisoned by the Soviet for being traitors to the nation, the conditions got even worse under the Soviet.

I am no historian and here/now have no source to back that up, so I will leave this here and try to come up with my source later, please delete my message if it doesn't fit the standard for this sub.
##
The Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp in Oranienburg (just outside Berlin) was used by the Soviets after the war as a detention facility. It's a rather odd place. The entire thing is triangular. Also worth noting, it wasn't a Nazi death camp. It was a work camp with separated secure facilities for high-value prisoners.
##
To clarify on Stalingrad story, nearly half of German POWs died within dozen days after their capitulation. Being marched to captivity in freezing temperatures on Russian steppe after been starved for months makes body exceptionally prone to to fatigue &amp; hypothermia.    
##
There was a pamphlet given to Red Army soldiers as they were nearing the German border that went, "Do not count the days. Do not count the miles. Count only the Germans you have killed. Kill the German - This is the cry of your Russian earth."
##
The Red Army is known for conducting massive rapes on the civilian populations in Germany and other areas which they now occupied. 

[Red Army Rapes in Occupied Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_during_the_occupation_of_Germany)

On a more anecdotal level, I have a great uncle that was killed shortly after the end of the war, because he intervened as Red Army troops tried to rape his fiance (this was in Poland).
##
Red Army atrocities against German civilians are still one of the more unexamined, nasty bits of the war.  I read [The Fall of Berlin](http://www.amazon.com/Fall-Berlin-1945-Antony-Beevor/dp/0142002801/ref=la_B000APGKKE_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385257489&amp;sr=1-4) a few years ago and its full of horrible events.  "They raped every German female from eight to 80" was one memorable quote from the book.

Here is a poem, written in 1942, by the Russian poet Konstantin Simonov.  It outlines how the Russians were to deal with the Germans.  It is just a poem, but I hope the mods let it stand here.  I think it captures the "esprit du temps" quite well.

The title of the poem is "[Kill Him](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=6a0_1366841683)".

(My favorite line..)

If your brother killed a German, 
If your neighbor killed one too, 
It's your brother's and neighbor's vengeance, 
And it's no revenge for you.
##
Did the Red Army take any of Hitler's command staff alive and were they tortured/used for propaganda in the USSR?
##
Two of the higher-ranking people to be captured in Berlin by the Soviets were [Helmuth Weidling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmuth_Weidling) and [Wilhelm Mohnke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Mohnke#Berlin). But they were basically middle-ranking military people, and the Soviets don't seem to have found it useful to make much propaganda use of them. Both were imprisoned for some years; Weidling died in 1955, and Mohnke was released in 1955 and allowed to move to West Germany.

Most of the higher-ranking people who survived the war deliberately arranged things so they could surrender to the Western Allies, who they assumed (with good reason) would treat them better.
##
I don't have much background in what went down with Mussolini's mob justice. Do you have any resources to look into or should I just jump onto wikipedia? Thanks, and your comment was an interesting read
##
I've tried to type this out twice, and both times when I went to copy the links my post got deleted, I might have to post this and edit the sources in after.

The fact that I (until I edited it a moment ago) misspelled his name stands as evidence of how qualified I am to discuss Mussolini (besides the limited connection between his life and Ezra Pound's). That being said the following links provide more context than the wikipedia article. [This one](http://www.historytoday.com/john-foot/dead-duce) gives a more detailed account of his death, and [this one](http://www.historyinanhour.com/2010/04/28/execution-of-mussolini), while broader in scope, gives some information about the mindset of the Italian peole regarding Il Duce at the time of his death.

Marshal Zhukov promised Stalin he would bring Hitler to Moscow in a cage.

&gt; Anticipating victory, Zhukov promised to send the captured Adolf Hitler in an iron cage through Kiev on his way to Moscow; however, the Fiihrer had anticipated the fate prepared for him an took poison, and Zhukov was not able to fulfil the promise.

[Nikita Khrushchev and the Creation of a Superpower
 By Sergei N. Khrushchev](http://books.google.com.au/books?id=dQeahlZdM7sC&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;ots=MzCnVTEvmo&amp;dq=zhukov%20hitler%20captured%20cage&amp;pg=PA210#v=onepage&amp;q=zhukov%20hitler%20captured%20cage&amp;f=false)

(That would have been something to see.)
##
As far as I'm aware, Khrushchev's 1970 memoirs are the only source for this story, though. Khrushchev claims Zhukov told him this on the phone; at the time, Khrushchev was head of the Communist Party in Ukraine, hence likely the mention of Kiev.
##
[Robert Service mentions the story](http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Y0__JEDpitYC&amp;lpg=PR105&amp;ots=b1ZtYQWEYV&amp;dq=%22Allegedly%20Stalin%20had%20wanted%20Hitler%20caught%20alive%22&amp;pg=PR105#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Allegedly%20Stalin%20had%20wanted%20Hitler%20caught%20alive%22&amp;f=false) also, although he seems to doubt Stalin would have carried through with it.

&gt; Allegedly Stalin had wanted Hitler caught alive and was annoyed by his suicide, and there was a story that Zhukov had vowed to parade him in a cage on Red Square.

We can't know for sure when it comes to historical "what ifs" though.
##
Just because hes dead they wouldn't parade him?
##
It's not just that, his body was burned to the point of being basically unrecognizable. Which, annoyingly, has spawned a ton of conspiracy theories. 
##
Plans over what to do with Nazi leadership were debated between the Allied leadership and shifted throughout the course of the war. I don't believe its truly possible to definitively state that any single course of action would have been planned and followed through had Hitler been taken alive. While the Moscow Declaration of 1943 did state that punishment for crimes with no specific geographic locale would be handled jointly by the Allied powers, this could be open to interpretation. As the Red Army reached Berlin significantly before the other Allied powers, if Hitler we're alive he would have surely been under Soviet custody. Whether Stalin would claim that the extreme Soviet losses in the course of the war gave a specific geographic locale for (many of) Hitler's crimes and thus allowed themselves to take charge in meting out punishment is a highly likely possibility, it cannot be positively concluded. 

As for what the specific punishment would have been, as I previously mentioned the thoughts of the Allied leadership on the matter of general post-victory punishment shifted as the war progressed and concluded. There was disagreement over how to punish Nazis generally upon the war's conclusion at the Tehran Conference in 1943. The intent of Stalin (who would have had custody of Hitler) at the conference can be seen in his suggestion to simply summarily execute roughly 50,000 German officers. A simple summary execution (whether under official Red Army auspices or more akin to the fate of Muammar Gaddafi), is certainly one likely possibility. Although the other Allied leaders were somewhat less bloodthirsty than Stalin in their thinking regarding the punishment of Nazi leadership, immediately executing Hitler and definitely ending the war in Europe is a likely scenario.

On the note of trials, it is highly unlikely that Hitler would have been prosecuted by the German people. The judiciary of Germany was comprised just about exclusively of Nazi party members. The only Germans who could even theoretically prosecute Hitler somewhat reliably would have been those with communist leanings, which simply puts the ball into Stalin's court regardless. Were a trial to be held under strictly Soviet custody, there is absolutely no doubt that the event would be a show trial in Moscow leading to inevitable execution. If Stalin were instead to abide by the previous arrangement for joint decision making on the punishment of Nazi leadership, Hitler would have been tried jointly by the Allies at Nuremburg or potentially separately at a unique trial for himself alone. It should be noted that, essentially, all roads lead to execution. Any plans for the Denazification of Germany would have been seriously hampered by Hitler still being alive. The risk of Hitler returning, being freed, or acting as a living figurehead for a potential resurgence of Nazism would simply be too great. The only real questions are the exact method leading up to execution, and the extent of involvement from Truman and Churchill in it.

The TLDR: Post-war plans for the Nazi leadership in general differed between the Allied leadership. Given that Hitler was not captured alive, it cannot be definitively said that the potential road map for Allied leadership jointly dealing with Nazi leadership would have even been followed in Hitler's case. The only thing for certain is the conclusion: inevitable execution.
##
Some additional questions:  Was there a shared plan by all of the Allies or did each nation have their own plan for dealing with Hitler?  The Russians would have been most likely to capture him.  If there was a unified protocol, how likely is it that the Russians would have followed it?  How much did the other Allies trust Russia to be honest about Hitler's status?  
##
Another follow-up question: [according to the BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/kent/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_9363000/9363982.stm), a man claiming to be the brother-in-law of Hans Baur, Hitler's pilot, told the British that Baur was willing to kidnap Hitler and fly him to Britain. Is there any truth in this and if so what measures did the British put in place to deal with a captured Hitler? This story reeks of crackpottery to me.
##
Can anyone speak to any plans that the UK or US would have had if they had captured Hitler alive? 
##
Sorry man, but I looked through every comment in the HistoricalWhatIf thread that you linked, and not a single one actually answers the question - which leaves you with nothing but a source. Unfortunately, that doesn't stand up to the standards we enforce on this subreddit. 
##
In what way would they have executed him?
##
Most likely hanged as this was the primary form of execution used on those convicted of war crimes at the time. [This] (http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/nuremberg/meetthedefendants.html) lists the major figures who were put on trial and their ultimate fate.
