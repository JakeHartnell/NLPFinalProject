The Gun Control Act of 1968 was rooted in reactions to the Kennedy assassination. I'm hard pressed to find a non biased interpretation of events, and my own (pro gun) bias may restrict my ability to impartiality discuss it. 

Essentially,  GCA 1968 did away with mail order gun sales,  cut off importation of military surplus arms,  and imposed a complicated system to determine if a handgun could be imported. I believe the last two were as much a gimme to domestic manufacturers as much an effort to control the flow of guns. 

EDIT:  forgot words. 
##
Didn't Bobby's assasination have more of an impact than John's?


##
I believe the reason people associate it more with JFK's assassination is that Lee Harvey Oswald bought the rifle he shot JFK with through a mail-order catalog, a method which the law would go on to specifically address. 

Sirhan Sirhan shot RFK with a Iver Johnson revolver, but in a cursory attempt to look it up I can't find any info on how he obtained it, so I'm not sure if any aspects of the GCA were a reaction to the circumstances of his crime in particular.
##
The GCA was written and submitted prior to the assassination of RFK or MLK but voted on after those deaths. So, I don't think there would have been any direct influence in how it was written because of RFKs assassination. 
##
&gt; or MLK

There's an interesting question to be asked. Given how tense race relations were and how (seemingly) popular black militancy was, what was the white legislative and white public response to MLK's death? Did they fear riots like the George Zimmerman/OJ Simpson/Rodney King murders? 
##
I don't know if they *feared* riots as much as [there were riots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_assassination_riots). 
##
&gt;The riots were political fodder for the Republican party, which used fears of black urban crime to garner support for "law and order", especially in the 1968 presidential campaign

Oh wow, I didn't know it was a big part of Nixon's campaign. That's a much wider impact than it would be now. 
##
Kevin Phillips, the principal architect of that campaign tactic (the "Southern strategy"), updated his thoughts in a series of three books in the middle of the last decade. In short, he thought that increasing urban concentrations and shifting moods in "swing" voters in the Midwest were leading to a backlash beginning in 2008.

This is similar but distinct from arguments made at a similar time by Ruy Teixeira and John Judis about demographic churn changing the social realities of the electorate, if you're curious on the ultimate impact of Nixon's "law and order" strategy.

I should note that it is probably no coincidence that the Republicans elected President in the shadow of Nixon's '68 messaging (Nixon, Reagan, Bush, Bush) were from enormous "Sun Belt" states (California, California, Texas, Texas) that tilted for their home state candidates in addition to peeling away law and order votes in the southeast and southwest (and Midwestern suburbs).
##
What is the argument that mail order matters? Couldn't Oswald just as easily have walked into a gun shop in Dallas?
##
He could have, but eventually this act lead to paperwork requirements and record keeping. 
##
And yet they somehow knew that he ordered his gun through mail order and didn't buy it in a store.
##
Looks like it was through good old fashioned gumshoe [technique ]( http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-4.html) From the National Archives. 
##
It's almost like assassinating the President results in a thorough investigation. Suspicious. 
##
I couldn't say with certainty, I'm not an expert in gun legislation, but my guess would be that it has to do with the fact that mail-order systems just make the process even more anonymous and difficult to track, but it obviously depends on which side of the debate you're on in terms of whether that's a good or a bad thing. The argument that it was undesirable seems to have won the day in 1968. And yes I can't imagine that if you were a clean-cut white guy looking to get a gun in 1960s Texas that you would have even the slightest problem in any gun shop.

Ironically, the NRA (whose membership and constituency was then, as now, primarily white) during this era was actually much more open to the idea of gun control because, among other issues, the Black Panthers were following an increasingly militant bent, adopting the philosophy that they had to exercise their right to bear arms to protect themselves from violent whites who opposed the advance of the civil rights movement, and the idea of a bunch of heavily armed black Americans with continued easy access to guns was a disquieting prospect to a number of whites. It's been awhile since my college courses in American history but I vaguely remember this playing into the gun control debate in the 60s and 70s as well.
##
The NRA shifted their focus as a result of the "Cincinnati Revolt" in 1977, where a break between the old traditionalists who wished to remain more apolitical and the new breed who wanted to become a major political force lead to a drastic turn in the NRA's philosophy as the new breed took control of the organization.

[This is a long piece, but it is quite excellent in regards to the history of the NRA and the gun rights debate in America in general.](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/04/23/120423fa_fact_lepore)
##
You know, I've seen a lot of political discussion about that these past few months, but nothing really discusses what the gun control side was doing at the time. Wasn't there a push for new gun control legislation a year or so before that? It seems unfair to blame the rift on the NRA 'new breed' when they were reacting to outside forces as well. 
##
Mr. Zhukov is quite right.  The NRA more or less abandoned its traditionally moderate position circa 1977 when there was a shakeup in leadership.  Prior to that point, it was still mostly an organization that was primarily focused on gun safety and marksmanship education and wasn't as political as we know the modern NRA to be - it was rather supportive of the two landmark pieces of US gun regulation legislation: the Gun Control Acts of 1934 and 1968.

It was initially founded in New York following the American Civil War because Union officers were concerned about the lack of marksmanship among their soldiers.  Its headquarters were moved to Virginia in the mid-1990s, in large part because of the "new wave" dissatisfaction with the growingly left-leaning politics in the northeastern US, which included a movement for increased gun regulation following the increasing urban violence in the 1980s.  I don't want to give the impression, though, that they've entirely abandoned marksmanship and gun safety education - those are still active pursuits of the organization - however, they're much better known for their vocal opposition to virtually all proposals to further regulate gun ownership and sales in recent years.
##
 &gt;their vocal opposition to virtually all proposals to further regulate gun ownership and sales in recent years

Not quite. A decent amount of gun rights activists now see the NRA as far too political and compromising, going so far as to call the NRA sell-outs.  That's why [Gun Owners of America](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_Owners_of_America) was formed.
##
It certainly didn't come out of nowhere. It was building up since the GCA in 1968. Cincinnati was where it came to a head, with the Old Breed wanting to move the headquarters to Denver (IIRC).
##
I think your view of the NRA might be somewhat skewed. For example, in the 1950's in Monroe NC a WWII veteran and civil rights demonstrator Robert Williams  set up a chapter of the NRA specifically to arm local black men. The Klu Klux Klan was highly active in the area and regularly harassed a local black doctor. This group of black armed veterans set up sandbags around the house and when the KKK showed up the next time exchanged fire with them. The KKK never came around again. 

He later ended up rather radicalized and in is mentioned as an inspiration by the founder of the Plack Panthers, but claiming that the NRA as a whole was racist is a vast oversimplification. 

In fact many instance of gun control were influenced directly by racism. The movement to ban "saturday night specials" was a pretty thinly veiled attempt to disarm urban blacks. It put a defacto financial bar to owning a means of self defense. In fact many of the gun bans that have been enacted in our country were targeted squarely at minorities. 

Among the first laws banning firearms were ones put in place after the civil war aimed at preventing freed black men from owning firearms and limiting gun ownership more or less to the upper classes ( look at the Army and Navy Law of 1879). 

It's just not as simple as saying that the NRA is mostly white and so mostly racist.  

edit: on second thought you may be thinking about the incident in California where the Black Panthers openly carried firearms at the capitol building which directly led to California banning open carry. 
##
While I do not want this to sound as though I disagree with you, I do want to point out that, as noted elsewhere, the NRA was a very different organization prior to 1977.  Post-Civil War, the northeastern US was strongly Republican and the Republican Party at the time looks very little like the Republican Party of today.  The changes in the NRA could fairly well be looped into the mid-20th century political re-alignment. 
##
It's my understanding that the Republican Party at the time we are discussing was the more progressive one and led for instance passing the Civil Rights Act. But I don't actually get the connection here, we were talking about the NRA, not any particular political party. 

And also it's not unimportant to bring up the fact that the NRA was founded by Union Civil War Veterans who had just finished fighting a war in which abolishing slavery was the main point of contention. I'm not a member of the NRA myself but I do hear a lot people implying it's a racist organization without any knowledge of what it does or where it came from. One of the NRA's first presidents was Ulysses S Grant, an abolitionist and responsible for breaking the KKK the first time around as well as passing the 15th amendment. The only agenda of the NRA for most of it's history was to encourage marksmanship in the general population even if in more modern times they seem mostly to just lobby for the firearms manufacturing industry. 

So I'm not sure I understand your claim here, are you claiming that the NRA was racist in the past (against all the evidence I've stated) or do you think it is racist now? Either one seems to be painting with a pretty broad brush at the very least. 
##
The Republican Party played no "leading role" in passing the Civil Rights Act.  Yes, the most racist electeds in the country were Southern Dixiecrats (Dems), but the northern liberal wing of the Democratic Party, such as Hubert Humphrey and Paul Douglas, were always its main advocates.   JFK pushed for a civil rights bill, and LBJ got it through, with pretty much all Dems other than Dixiecrats voting for it.  The lead sponsors were mostly Dems, though Republican Everett Dirkson did end up supporting it.
##
which party had a higher percentage of votes for the Civil Rights Act?
##
I'm not sure how my comment could be construed, in any way, to mean that I was claiming that the NRA is or ever was a racist organization.  I would agree that it would be painting with a mighty broad brush, indeed.
##
The GCA wasn't anchored in the JFK assassination, that was just the pretext used to gain popular support.  The GCA finds its roots in California wanting to disarm the Black Panthers and other militant civil rights groups.  It's important to realize that civil rights protestors were arming and that the middle class was terrified of the perceived threat.  California (I keep mentioning them because they really led the way) and several other states began creating the first real gun control laws in 30 years to try and disarm blacks.  

Pressure continued to build at the federal level as the middle class became more concerned about radical blacks with guns.  Imagine terrorism concerns circa 2003 and replace terrorists with radical blacks.  With that background, the JFK assassination was the final straw that pushed the bill from obscurity into popular politics.

Since most gun shop owners were white and wouldn't sell to blacks, most blacks purchased their guns through mail order.  By eliminating mail order, the bill's supporters hoped to make it harder for blacks to buy guns.  Going further, the bill also made guns more expensive in hopes that it would make the poor (often blacks) unable to afford them.
##
This is a nuance of the civil rights movement I had never considered. It's obvious that voting rights were manipulated, but it never occurred to me that 2nd admendmen rights might have been purposefully skewed as well.

Can you suggest any reading I could do to learn more about this?
##
Depending on your own politics, I would start here http://www.saf.org/lawreviews/tahmassebi1.html (pro-gun site, but very well cited academic paper on the history of racism and gun control) or, if you prefer an anti-gun source the book 'Saturday Night Special' discusses gun control during the civil rights movement and is written by a self-described anti-2A advocate.  

They both reach the same conclusion about the GCA68 law being designed to disarm the black civil rights movement.
##
Thanks. I'm a boojum when it comes to 2nd amendment issues. I honestly don't know what the hell to think, and the more I learn the less I'm sure of, if that makes any sense. I appreciate you giving me sources from more than one viewpoint. I want to learn what happened, without crippling myself with a bias from the start.
##
I'm not 100% sure of policies regarding checks back then, but he may have run into some issues as he was diagnosed with mental issues by two different doctors and had troubles in the Marines related to violence and insubordination.
##
Gun shop, hardware store, department store, yeah he could have gotten the gun or a gun easily anywhere.
##
I don't know much about guns at all- is Iver Johnson a very common make? I know that President McKinley was shot with an Iver Johnson as well.
##
They were an affordable gun, a couple steps above cheap. Decent, but not spectacular. Taurus to a Colt to use modern comparison. 
##
Iver Johnson is no longer the company that existed back then.  They went out of business in 1993, and the name and branding was sold to a new owner who does not produce any products or parts related to the old line.  According to wikipedia, their primary business was inexpensive revolvers.
##
Were there any calls for outright bans or gun-free zone like Chicago?
##
I can't recall reading of any,  but the background of gca68 has been less of a study for me, than how it affected gun ownership and the industry.  It was nearly single handedly responsible for the "Saturday Night Special " industry in California for instance, but that's drifting off topic. I'll put up an LA Times interview I was quoted in about the industry, and some background I wrote for guns.com in the Friday Free For All though. 
##
Yes, California created several of them when black civil rights protestors began carrying guns in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

##
Can you cite about gunshops not selling to whites? I know militant civil rights groups were seen as a problem. In California, bans on carry of arms were passed just before a scheduled Black Panthers protest. Washington State passed a law prohibiting the unlawful use of a weapon to intimidate another, yet oddly failed to bar the open display of arms in public buildings or locations. (Many persons believe this is because of how the Washington State Constitution is written, and it's not all that uncommon to see open carry of sidearms in Washington state still, so perhaps the Panthers weren't that much of a perceived threat, or our constitution really limited how their actions could be restricted, dunno.)

Now, it's true GCA 68 greatly reduced the sort of inexpensive handguns and such that were coming in from Europe, it did little to stem the flow. Various loopholes were found, such as assembling full guns from parts in the United States, and then building imported parts on a domestic frame. Most notably, firms like FIE (Firearms Import and Export) were building inexpensive .25 autos on domestic frames with Italian parts. RG Rhom .22 revolvers came in the same way.  If anything, it caused a domestic "saturday night special" industry to spring up starting with[Raven Arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven_Arms_MP-25), (poorly sourced but less biased) Here is another source, but it's from a fairly biased series done by [PBS](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/guns/ring/families.html)

Essentially, I would argue that there was less a deliberate attempt to target poor blacks and poor people with GCA 68 as there was an attempt to target the cheap and easy to get guns that were coming in from Europe; namely WWII surplus bolt action rifles and military handguns, and inexpensive pocket pistols. And while it may have cut off cheap European military surplus, it only encouraged a domestic source for small, cheap handguns. I'm hard pressed to see race having anything directly to do with it.  I think GCA 68 came from a perfect storm of militant civil rights groups, high level assassinations, and a government fearful of civil unrest among the populace, and was sold as a safety measure. 
##
The language used in promoting the bill is also telling, the term Saturday Night Special has its roots in the term ''Niggertown Saturday Night.' 

You should read "The Saturday Night Special."  It's a book written by an avowed anti-second amendment journalist  Robert Sherrill. Even he admits that the GCA68 was passed entirely to try and disarm blacks and discusses those racist motivations.  There are more sources, but he's particularly good one since he's also very anti-gun, but still discusses the law's racist motivations honestly and provided ample evidence to back it up.

There are fun pullquotes like this:
"Some very interesting laws are being passed. They don't name me; they don't say, take the guns away from the niggers. They say that people will no longer be allowed to have (guns). They don't pass these rules and these regulations specifically for black people, they have to pass them in a way that will take in everybody." -- Eldridge Cleaver, Black Panther Leadership,  1968

Now this is bloody interesting. I've never heard this book cited before. I'll have to get a copy.  
##
Racism and gun control in the US have always been linked.   

I recommend reading this as a survey of the topic, it's very well cited. http://www.saf.org/lawreviews/tahmassebi1.html

ed: corrected link

##
I'm familiar with Clayton Kramer's writings on the subject, I wasn't aware that GCA 68 had that much inherent racism involved. 
##
I may have posted the wrong link,  I meant to link to Stefan B. Tahmassebi: http://www.saf.org/lawreviews/tahmassebi1.html

The GCA's passage was almost entirely based on a growing middle class fear of radicalized blacks in much the same way that the patriot act's passage was based on the middle class fear of terrorism.

Oswald used an italian model bolt action rifle in shooting JFK. Out of all types of guns, a bolt action rifle is going to be the last one to get outlawed. 

Malcolm X was initially shot with a shotgun, the second least likely gun to be taken away. 

Bobby was killed with a 22 revolver, the least threatening of all handguns. 

MLK was killed with a deer rifle. 

So, while the assassination sparked some debate it mainly shaped gun control by getting Johnson in office. Other than Ray, who would be barred from gun ownership as a felon no legislation would have stopped those deaths. 

Whilst there was debate, there was no real change until 1968. Most likely due to the fact that the only way of stopping the shooting would have been drastic legislation that would probably take away nearly all guns in the U.S.
##
Hmm very interesting. Were semi-autmotic rifles less popular at the time or was it just a coincidence that all the guns used in those political murders were small/basic?
##
In 63, war surplus bolt action rifles and common hunting rifles were rather common, as well as surplus M1 carbine and Garand rifles. However, the market still hadn't shifted to the demand for semi auto rifles. That evolved as new generations of soldiers sought newer styles of rifles, and legislative threats made certain classes of rifles more popular and visible, which drives sales. 
##
&gt; That evolved as new generations of soldiers sought newer styles of rifles

I don't think this is a fair statement. I think it would be more accurate to say the most prevalent forms of shooting changed. in the 1950s and 60s most shooting would have been for hunting purposes were a bolt action is often preferable for its higher precision where as in the 80s forward competition shooting and range days became more common place. Most fire arms owners now have never hunted and likely will never hunt.




edit: higher precision should be higher precision to cost ratio.
##
I hope this isn't getting too off topic, but wouldn't a lever action be better for precision, at least at under 150 yards and especially with regard to precision to cost?  While I understand there were quite a few surplus bolt-action rifles following WWII (which would have been widely available at the time of the assassination), the lever action was still quite popular from the mid- to late-19th century into the early- to mid-20th.  
##
The kind of action really doesn't have any direct impact on the accuracy of the weapon.  I mean, many automatic machine guns are highly accurate.  Accuracy comes from a fast bullet with lots of speed, a long barrel, rifling.

Semi-automatic fire adds weight to the gun, usually means a bigger magazine, makes it more unreliable and maintenance heavy, and some other stuff.

Long rifles are often bolt action simply because the combination of recoil + range means that your refire time is going to be substantial since you are going to have to completely re-sight your target, so semi-automatic fire doesn't really do anything for you.  Plus you aren't firing a lot of bullets so a big magazine or high RoF don't do much for you.

So it makes more sense to save the weight, cut down on moving parts, etc.

##
Quality lever action rifles tend to cost a minimum of 30% more than a quality bolt gun. The cheapest good levers around currently run in the $700-900 TLR Ange depending. Cheap bolt guns that will hit 1 MOA start around $450-500 and by the $900 mark you can get sub.5 MOA bolt guns while the lever action are in the area of 1 moa. The cost of the action brings up the cost of the arm. Lever actions are complicated compared to bolt actions.
##
Anecdotal:

I'm an Iraq-era Army vet, and I have definitely observed that fellow vets by M-16 variants most often.  When you are trained on a rifle in the service, you feel comfortable buying the civilian equivalent.


##
I agree that vets often get ars but people like me ( I never would have passed the physical test to get in) also love the ar because its a great platform when well maintained.
##
Oh I agree its a good weapon.  I'm sure people buy it for lots of reasons, but I think that the fact that it is the standard issue military weapon is a major factor for vets.
##
In the early 60's, there weren't a ton of semi-auto rifles on the market for consumers that were inexpensive/widely available.  M1 Garands (classic American WW2 rifle) hadn't really been released to the public as surplus through the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP), but lots of full-auto stuff was floating around still (Thompsons, BAR's, M2 carbines, the list goes on). 

However, when you're assassinating someone you either want to be really close (so your gun needs to be concealable), or really accurate (you're shooting from far away). 

Charles Guiteau, Gavrilo Princip, John Wilkes Booth, Jack Ruby, all of these assassins aimed to kill public figures up close, and in a crowd.  If you haul a gun out around the President or other important figure whilst in a crowd, expect to get jumped.  Therefore, we're right back to small and concealable, handguns being a great choice.  The guy that killed Bobby Kennedy (Sirhan Sirhan) used an Iver-Johnson .22 revolver, which is just about one of the cheapest guns that you could hope to lay hands on.  He either didn't have access to anything better or didn't know any better.  

James Earl Ray served in the Army during WW2, Oswald was in the Marine Corps, along with the UT Texas clocktower sniper.  Marksmen in the army during those times had plenty of exposure to bolt action rifles (Springfield '03, or the M1917) as "sniper" weapons, and the Marine Corps makes damn sure it's soldiers can shoot. 

What do all of the guns used have in common?

* Cheap
* Available to the public
* Assassins had prior exposure to the platform (in the case of Oswald, Ray, and Charles Whitman the UT Texas shooter). 
* Every assassin chose a weapon that fit their method...the guys that got in close used handguns, the ex-soldiers used bolt-action rifles suitable for hitting a man at several hundred yards. 

**TL;DR*- A little bit of both, to be honest.

Yes, if the GCA was in effect at the time he would have had to purchase one from a store, or a guns show, or a private dealer, or still get it through the mail but from a private party or a federally licensed dealer.
