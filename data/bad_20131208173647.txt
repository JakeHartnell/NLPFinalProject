Just listened to 'Saturday' - Rebecca needs to re-do this song.. 'Saturday' 
is so much better compared to this. Ôªø
##
She should not re-do this song. The song sucks. The lyrics suck. The vocals 
suck. Even the rapping sucked. The music sucked. If she did re-do this 
song, the only thing she would keep is the title.Ôªø
##
The Pimple! LolÔªø
##
OVER A MILLION DESLIKE!! you people are just bad hhhhÔªø
##
There is only one seat fucking left you idiot !!!Ôªø
##
Hey I remember listening to this song backwards a few years back!Ôªø
##
Her friends are ugly Ôªø
##
She Love To Learn Her Days Of The Week....Ôªø
##
AUTOTUNE really?!?!?! Btw voice is soooooo squeakyÔªø
##

dislikes

##

i don't remember casting the tsukuyomi, yet.Ôªø
##
who wrote thisÔªø
##
omg the female R.Kelly yes!Ôªø
##
I feel like that black dude was her math teacher or somethingÔªø
##
Saturday is actually so great compared to this, plus it makes fun of Friday 
which I think is awesomeÔªø
##
SOOOO CHEESYYYÔªø
##
I just realized she's driving on the highway with completely new friends . 
Only took me 2 years to find that out .................. üòêÔªø
##

much autotune ! My ears are scared! Please stop making musicÔªø
##

##
You know how chinese food was purposely bad? The black guy in this is the 
smame as in that. I think this was made to be purposely bad too.Ôªø
##
This sucksÔªø
##
She is.... NevermindÔªø
##

##
i still can't tell if this is a joke or not...Ôªø
##
Wtf was that ? Ôªø
##
when they say YEAH the twelve year old boys sound like menÔªø
##
She needs some nasal decongestant.Ôªø
##
you all dont need to be such jerks to her. she is one of my favorite 
youtubers and if you all dont like it, then share that somewhere else.Ôªø
##
I like her saturday song. Way better than Friday :) 
Also I love Rebecca Black !!! <3Ôªø
##
classic.Ôªø
##
Worst.Song.Ever.Ôªø
##
What the wiggles 0_oÔªø
##
I like when she sings now but I still almost sing thing almost every Friday 
Ôªø
##
hiÔªø
##
Who the Fuck was that rapper?!?!Ôªø
##
Repeating the name of the days in the week is apperantly what she hopes 
will drive her music "carreer". Also, all this stating the obvious is 
just...omg. "Today is friday, tomorrow is saturday..." From Saturday: 
"Today is Saturday and yesterday was Friday". No shit, sherlock. What's 
next?  You're going to tell us that water is wet and fire is hot?Ôªø
##
I miss the auto-tune and the pronunciations she makes on Friday.Ôªø
##
the dislikes... lolÔªø
##
Week sorryÔªø
##
Kishan Korai, please go kill yourself.  Thanks.Ôªø
##
came here with a positive and open mind. Listened everything. And now I 
know why everyone was bitchin' about Rebecca Black. the longer I listen the 
more headache. Ôªø
##
hmmmmm does she know you should not record with a cold??Ôªø
##
soft autotune is magic... but not enough to make this shit sound betterÔªø
##
Lmao... This is the worst song ever made. I like her but whoever produced 
this is a mess. Ôªø
##
Is the girl on her left not her friend?Ôªø
##
Every Friday, I ask one of mates what they're supposed to do, they sigh and 
say, "Get Down?"Ôªø
##
Friday was such a great day before she fucked it upÔªø
##
NOBODY HATE SHE DID NOT EVEN WRITE THIS SONG WATCH HER DRAW MY LIFE VIDEO 
SO HATERS DON'T HATE!!!!!!!!!Ôªø
##
If everybody hates this song why are ppl even clicking on the vid. Ôªø
##
Lol over 1000000 dislikes
Ôªø
##
She actually is pretty if you think she ugly it probably means you can't 
get someone like her but only her singing sucksÔªø
##
she is soooo gunna go miley cyrusÔªø
##
Listened to Saturday.. Wayyyyy better then this song but.. now i hate 
friday because of this song -.-Ôªø

##
61 million views after the original was taken down damnÔªø
##

##
Wow...my cancer just got aidsÔªø
##
Stop hating on a girl whos dream came true. Her parents must have the money 
to allow her to do it. You wouldnt like it if you were in her shoes so 
shhhhÔªø
##
1:55 i swear he hit her assÔªø
##
Now she is probably making Sunday.Ôªø
##
rebecca go to school and stop the damn singingÔªø
##
everyone who is saying negative things about this video go fuck yourself 
your just jealous that you cant be her okay and talk bad about me all you 
want i dont care Ôªø
##
She made a bad song. So what. Back the off and let her live her life 
instead of being inconsistent dick heads. Ôªø
##
Fuck u gota get down on ur kneesÔªø
##
Fun.fun.fun.Ôªø
##

##
Cant Wait For Sunday! XDÔªø
##

##
This must be a parody of sorts. Whoever wrote this was mocking the shitty 
state of music nowadays. Ôªø
##
the day this came out also became know as The Black FridayÔªø
##
i feel bad for the people who had to pretend to be her friendsÔªø
##
Saturday made me do it.Ôªø
##
What is the meaning of this song?? Is it to teach kids the days of the 
week?Ôªø
##
o shut the hell upÔªø
##
Her next song is gonna be SundayÔªø
##
Jasmine Villegas Is WAY better Than Rebecca Who Else Agree?Ôªø

##
I'm sure its a ton of fun riding a car in front of a green screenÔªø
##

##

should children this young be able to drive a auto-mobile let alone wipe

pop song.Ôªø

NEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ôªø
##
This has the most dislikes I have ever seen in my life. I'm just gonna like 
it for no reasonÔªø
##
This song doesnt make sense.... But thank you for telling me what comes 
before and after Friday.... If it wasnt for this song ... I would think it 
was Tuesday, Friday, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Sunday and Saturday..... 
Why would party on Friday?? Shouldnt she be studying so she doesnt make any 
more music? Ôªø
##
atleast this song is educational (teaches you about the days of the week), 
and not about sex and drugs and becoming an alcoholic. right? but when my 
kids get in trouble someday, ill play this song for them, and keep playing 
it until they beg for forgiveness.Ôªø
##
there was a guy behind the car at 2:41Ôªø
##
This is actually a really deep, metaphorical song that shows the corruption 
of governments and leaders around the world.Ôªø
##
Just when I thought it couldn't get n e worse bahahaha. I rest my case. 
She's horrible.Ôªø
##
You suck I think I'm going to kill myself after thatÔªø
##

##

##

##
She's pretty and but the voice is just too pitchy and odd her newer songs

##

at least the whole internet harrassed you on just one song you sungÔªø
##

Luv itÔªø
##
She's ulgy xddÔªø
##
Now Saturday why!!Ôªø
##
....... ._.'Ôªø
##
Around 2 years later, this girl can't be recognized. Maybe its coz Friday 
became Saturday. Also still can't believe i'm back here.Ôªø
##
years ago when this "song" came out i vowed not to watch the stupidity, but 
i figured it was about time. IT WAS NOT TIME! I feel like my brain has 
melted...Ôªø
##
I feel bad for her... watch her "Draw My Life". She paid these guys a lot 
of $$ and they did THIS :'(Ôªø
##
Where is rebecca black other song as like saturday,sunday 
monday,tuesday,wednesday,thrusday,girls you only make friday, you need make 
these songs too.Ôªø
##
wow... really first this song now u make a song calld saturday  are u going 
to make songs for the rest of the week Ôªø
##
please, Please, PLEASE tell me that this song is a joke. I mean, this gorl 
cant be serious about THAT. Im whicj fucking world does this girl love that 
her biggest problem is wether to sit in the front or in the backseat? WTF?Ôªø
##
More dislikes than likes awhÔªø
##
FACT: 99% of the people who appeared in this video have since commit 
suicide. The other 1% are still contemplating.Ôªø
##
Which seat can i take???? U can take the pathÔªø
##
fun fun fun friday friday ‚ô•Ôªø
##
This video made me laugh so hardÔªø
##
God this is painful
Ôªø
##
And Saturday exists ;-;Ôªø
##
WOW can it get any worst Your stupid.   Ôªø
##
...Ôªø
##
who came here after listening to saturday :pÔªø
##
I think I just got a brain f**k, salva me!Ôªø
##
Its just auto toned the whole songÔªø
##
WOW this is just bad .... disliked with some pride :)Ôªø
##
"Fun, fun, think about fun" is a genuinely unnerving line. It's almost like 
Rebecca doesn't actually believe it will be fun. Like she's stopped feeling 
joy long ago, and the only thing keeping her going is vague memories of 
happiness.

Tragically beautiful. Ôªø
##
It is def better than saturday. Plus she's fat now. Thats not good for 
anyone.Ôªø
##
That's a lot of auto tuneÔªø
##
*seeeeiiiiizeeueueerree//** csantnsaops pheeelp please god help ASDlask et 
sgr nsj dieng here.0o bÔªø
##
when i look at this i think that that my brain is sucked into a black holeÔªø
##
I know that her voice doesn't actually sound like that, but lord the lyrics 
are still stupid as crap.Ôªø
##
i'mÔªø
##
look at that dislikeÔªø
##
There is something I hate about this song...Ôªø
##
i forgot how hilarious this was! "We we we so excited"Ôªø
##
I am watching this song on sundayÔªø
##
Song sucks.Ôªø
##
like because i must everytime laugh :DÔªø
##
Seriously, did 67 million people come here to learn most of the days of the 
week? I will never understand this music or the draw to it.Ôªø
##
well... i don't like it but i also don't hate it so my opinion is mehÔªø
##
was that the rapper from chines food?Ôªø
##
this probably is the only vid that ive seen with more dislikes than likes Ôªø
##
swagÔªø
##
This sucksÔªø
##
well, apparently its friday :3Ôªø
##
plus to add to our misery she sucks at singing no wander she has music 
class on wensdayÔªø
##
Everybody is 12 years old in thisÔªø
##
so awsomeÔªø
##
Friday, then saturday what next? Sunday! :)Ôªø
##
#RebeccaBlacksuckssingingÔªø
##
That rap thoÔªø
##
I don't know if I ironically like this song or if I just generally like 
it...Ôªø
##
Wondering which seat she should take... Then she takes bitch seat... Ôªø
##
Hating much ‚ÜìÔªø
##
Its fried egg fried egg!Ôªø
##
thanks for teaching us the day of the week and teaching us that saturday 
come after friday and that there so many seats in a car thanks so much :{ 
 0.o o.0 u not seriousÔªø
##
she got fat as hell, she doesn't want her cake to end more likeÔªø
##
Omg shut the fuck uppp
Ôªø
##
Its sunday ya dumb beaver...Ôªø
##
Is it weird that i find it..CatchyÔªø
##
lol
##
better than saturday plus you were skinnierÔªø
##
It would be funny if she only got 1 like...... from herselfÔªø
##
Just.. No. Ôªø
##
*see the bads comments, bad rate (dislike)...*

i don't like but i don't hate this video... i listen just it...Ôªø
##
who came back to the video just to see how many dislikes there were!Ôªø
##
I wonder if actual teenage people do like this or .. ? Because this is 
seriously bad .Ôªø
##
She has a terrible voice, and this song sucksÔªø
##
this is horrible!!!! go to work, dedicate to something else _¬¥Ôªø
##
Well not that bad. I mean I could still remember the rhyme of this song 
now, one year after I heard the song for the first time... Its not 
masterpiece, but its not what "worst song ever". The song and lyrics are 
not written by her. She is the one who sings. Plus she is only 13 years old 
that time, what u want? She got these insulting comments since this video 
and for already 2+ years but she didn't delete it. She knew this song was 
bad. She made laugh of her own song. If thats not only a illusion that her 
manager had shown to me but her own purpose, I have to admit that she is 
really brave.Ôªø
##
I prefer "Friday". I don't like "Saturday"...Ôªø
##
how this is not a joke is beyond me Ôªø
##
my eight year old cuz can make a song better than thisÔªø
##
in retrospect dis shit is dope yo. And her voice sounds like Doseone. 
Really sublime.Ôªø
##
too much better than Saturday...Ôªø
##
what is this shit?Ôªø
##
Fun fun fun!! LOLÔªø
##
Wait, I'm really confused....what day is it?Ôªø
##
She was only 13 wat drivingÔªø
##
She sounds so bad! Like is nanny fran fron the nanny singing?Ôªø
##
The video is almost as worse as the green screen...Ôªø
##
FUN FUN FUN üò´üî´Ôªø
##
Her saying Friday hurts my teeth!Ôªø
##
so stupid that lyric but i really love that song because the GLEE cast sung 
it :DÔªø
##
how is this person gonna make money if she makes horrible song after 
horrible song?! WELL HOW ABOUT STOP SINGING ABOUT FUCKIN DAYS OF THE 
WEEK!!!!Ôªø
##
Stupid girl it's MondayÔªø
##
Like for just a joke which makes my life, dislike for the sucked 
production.  Ôªø
##
It still sucks
Ôªø
##
She gained weight and she was prettier here than in Saturday , both songs 
are crap thoughÔªø
##
its interesting how it took two whole years for Friday to turn into 
SaturdayÔªø
##
God damn it... I thought I got this out of my head last time...Ôªø
##
It's catchier than SaturdayÔªø
##
id rather listen to saturday for the rest of my life he voice is to effin 
highÔªø
##
Who else came here to compare this to Saturday.Ôªø
##
My farts sounds better than thisÔªø
##
that auto tune though......Ôªø
##
lmaoÔªø
##
When will this weekend endÔªø
##
I had to listen to Saturday to get this song out of my head. I knew a 
remedy would come some day!Ôªø
##
Anyway, I quite like it... Even though it sounds like she doesn't have a 
nose, I'd totally but it on iTunes. Ôªø
##
Glee make this music be good Ôªø
##
this sucks, its so annoyingÔªø
##
We love video games is better than this Ôªø
##
went here straight after listening to saturday <3Ôªø
##
It's the fact they are 12 and driving which makes the video for meÔªø
##
I love how you're still trying to make your channel a thing. you're a 
terribly overly dramatic attention whore who wants people to lick your 
boots. great job you poor dumb bastard.Ôªø
##
I thought her childish videos were over but I guess not shes on saturday 
what in the living fuckÔªø
##
The guy who produced this the record man whatever, ruins kids lives by 
producing horrible songs. (Thanksgiving)Ôªø
##
compare this with Saturday though..Ôªø
##
iconicÔªø
##
no offense Rebecca but the VIDEO is horrible but the actual song is kinda 
catchyÔªø
##
I really dont like this song ... But I dont understand the haters ... If 
you dont like it ... Dont listen to it -.- Its that simple :PÔªø

shut up i am so proud of her!!!!! HATERS GET OUT!!!!Ôªø
##
Is it just me or does she sound like a chipmunk? And why is a 12 year old 
driving a car?Ôªø

##

Yesterday friday, today Saturday, tomorrow sunday and keep going.. huh

##
Everybody listen to saturday by rebecca lol it's not what you expectÔªø
##
it took you 2 years to make Saturday, guess we gotta wait another 2 years 
for SundayÔªø
##
Seeing this after see Saturday.... is horrible to know she has THIS 
begginingÔªø
##
I...what?  61 Million views?  And there's a new song?  This is just the 
worst thing ever.  Seriously. Ôªø
##

##
"Yesterday was Thursday." "Tomorrow is Saturday. Sunday comes after." No 
shit, Sherlock.Ôªø
##
Friday friday the next is saturdayÔªø
##
Why the fuck would she make a song called "Saturday".... 
-_-Ôªø
##
Rebecca has gotten much better over the years. Ôªø
##
there's a video that records her trying to watch this...even she has a hard 
time getting through it. At the end she says 'im glad its over'Ôªø
##
well she made a Saturday sooooo she hasn't learned xD LOLOLÔªø
##
Worst teen song ever ewÔªø
##
i was told not to watch this. no offense but i agree. i like most of your 
other vids but not this one :\Ôªø
##
She forced herself to watch this once. She almost couldn't do it. At the 
end she said "Thank god thats over"Ôªø
##
How old was she when she made this vid? I mean seriously, how horrible can 
it get...Ôªø
##
The dislike LOLÔªø
##
its still horible muted and minimizedÔªø
##
This is the first time i've watched the video... Wish i hadn't but Saturday 
made me think i shouldÔªø
##
It's not her. It's those hack-job music producers who wrote this trashy 
song and butchered the mixing and the music video.

ARK Music Factory. They couldn't produce a decent song to save their lives. 
I could make a better recording in my basement then they could do in their 
studios.Ôªø
##
Vomit is covering my screen.Ôªø
##
I love how they're all obviously too young to drive, but they pick the 
youngest looking kid they can.. haha. the driver looks 12.Ôªø
##
FUN FUN FUN FUN!!!Ôªø
##
Can we just take a minute to recognize that there are like, 5 times as many 
dislikes are there are likes. Holy what evenÔªø
##
1:54 it looks like that dude grabs her ass lolÔªø
##
took one look at the likes and dislikes for this video and just lost it. 
Fuckin lmaoÔªø
##
Why are you guys so rude?! I mean it's not the BEST song , but I'm sure you 
guys wouldn't like it if you tried your best and everybody criticized you.Ôªø
##
this shit gay bruhÔªø
##
I would love this song if I goddamn sucked at English, but I don't, so Duck 
this sh1tÔªø
##
Best lyrics everÔªø
##
Since she was 13 when she made this video.. It makes it more funnierÔªø
##
seriously people, i understand it might not be the best video out there, 
but is it really necessary to hate? she's a human being and she has 
feelings too. how would you feel if you put out a music video that you were 
really proud of and everyone hates it and is telling you to "go slit your 
throat." ITS JUST A SONG, CALM DOWN. omg. besides, if you dont like it, 
dont watch it. Ôªø
##
I mean backÔªø
##
Such talent.... Ôªø
##
Bad autotune + Nasally voice = THISÔªø
##
WtfÔªø
##
I actually think this girl has broken a youtube record for most dislikes on 
a video ever. to all the people saying 'your hate is just making her more 
famous', may I remind you that Osama bin laden was pretty famous too.. just 
saying.Ôªø
##
is that a wart on her cheke?Ôªø
##
+1gcm u put pb on ur nipples and pretend ur a sloth. Wtf is a matter with u 
D:Ôªø
##
Friday Friday ... Gonna slit ur throat on Friday :DÔªø
##
Holy crap over a million dislikes Ôªø
##
No. Just... no. This is classified as audio homicide...Ôªø
##
Ha Saturday brought me back here.Ôªø
##

##
ITS SUNDAY SUNDAY  GOT TO GO TO SLEEP ON SUNDAY OMGÔªø

criterion here.Ôªø

and I'm not disappointed after all. Ôªø
