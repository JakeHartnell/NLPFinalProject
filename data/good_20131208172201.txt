In the 1970s, the city was on the verge of bankruptcy and a huge amount of city services suffered from disinvestment, which also plagued the subways well into the 1980s. A recession began in 1969 that did not begin to lift until 1977, which negatively impacted many of the city’s industries (trucking had all but destroyed South Street Seaport, the fish markets and the freight railroads). A lot of people felt unsafe, and many folks left, sometimes leaving entire blocks of buildings abandoned (there are still a few partially-abandoned blocks in Hell’s Kitchen); by the end of the decade more than a million people had left the city. That said, the city was taking in a large amount of immigrants, which added to the already growing ethnic tensions and started to change the demographics of certain neighborhoods. 

Midway through the decade, New York State took over most of the city’s finances, and immediately those in charge fired 60,000 municipal employees, cut a quarter of teachers, put an end to free tuition at CUNY and marked a significant policy change whereby the private interests of the city trumped the public ones. This coincided with the aforementioned policy of disinvestment, prompting numerous strikes by the Sanitation Department, who at certain points refused to pick up trash at all, letting it rot on the streets for days, prompting the nickname “stink city.” By the middle of the decade, most of the fires in the city were arson, and there were yearly riots; some building owners paid teenagers to set their buildings on fire so they could collect the insurance money. The most famous riot, the 1977 Blackout, saw looting in 31 neighborhoods and caused over $300 million in damages in less than 25 hours, with more than 3,700 people arrested. At the same time, the city was turning its attention towards revitalizing Times Square, which was an indicator of the “dual city” that would be crafted through the “Disneyfication” of certain areas, contrasted with the seedy underbelly that was more often than not right around the corner (i.e. the monolithic Marriot Hotel with sex shops lining nearby 8th Avenue); I get a little more into it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1nsjzp/how_did_nonamericans_regard_new_york_city_in_the/cclormi), where I also talk about the growth and revitalization of the tourism industry and the impact of Milton Glaser’s famous I &lt;3 NY logo. 

Ultimately, a lot of the problems that we complain about today have their roots in the tumultuous decade of the 1970s (i.e. rampant homelessness, vast income disparity). Crime rates continued to rise throughout the 1980s, and only began to drop in the early 1990s, partially the result of initiatives on the part of Mayors Dinkins and Giuliani. That said, it was not nearly as gloomy as people often portray it to be. The World Trade Center complex opened in 1973 and while it did destroy the famous Radio Row, it became an important icon for the city and served as a significant economic center during the 1980s. I would also argue that the 1970s saw the emergence and flourishing of several important subcultures, including the gay community, the punk rock culture and the hip-hop movement (which was furthered by the 1977 blackout, where young MCs got access to more advanced equipment). 

I’m heading to bed right now so I apologize for any of my tired sentences. I will answer any replies or questions in the morning and clarify anything if need be. If you are interested in learning more about this period in New York City history, I highly recommend the following works: [Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx is Burning: 1977, Baseball, Politics and the Battle for the Soul of a City](http://www.amazon.com/Ladies-Gentlemen-Bronx-Is-Burning-ebook/dp/B005N8Y5Y6/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1), [Branding New York: How a City in Crisis was Sold to the World](http://www.amazon.com/Branding-New-York-Crisis-Cultural-ebook/dp/B000SK5BOW/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1), [The Restless City](http://www.amazon.com/The-Restless-City-History-Colonial-ebook/dp/B003PJ7EH0/ref=tmm_kin_title_0) (particularly Chapters 9 and 10, but it is a great book overall), and [The City that Became Safe: New York’s Lessons for Urban Crime and Its Control](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199324166) (this last book takes a look at declining crime rates since the 1990s but is nevertheless a fascinating read). 
##
Do you have a source for the '77 blackout and subsequent looting putting advanced audio equipment in the hands of young hip-hop artists? I'm not doubting you at all; it just seems like a really fascinating small thing to read more about.
##
There's a hip hop documentary that spends a bit of time covering it fairly early on in the program but I can't for the life of me remember what it's called right now. I watched the whole thing on YouTube about a year ago it was split into 7 or 8 parts and looked like it was already pretty old, I think it was made in the early-mid 2000s. If I remember anything else I'll edit it on to this post.

I can't believe the stuff that is floating out there. Every time I come in here I find something that looks really interesting that I didn't even know I wanted to see..
##
Great Doc, The bit about the blackout and a boom in DJ's re: Looting. However its not early it's at about 41mins in.


##
I bet Brain Rot covers some of it, but you'd have to wade through 

http://boingboing.net/2013/10/15/brain-rot-hip-hop-family-tree-75.html
##
Watch the documentry NY 77, the coolest year in hell. I think that was the name. 
##
I found that interesting too. When you think of it though, hip hop definitely relied on equipment. DJ equipment, keyboards with primitive sampling functions, maybe even some drum machines (not sure if they were around that early) but the equipment and getting it in to the hands of the first hip hop generation. 
##
Primitive Drum machines and electronic druns were around, samplers were the size of refrigerators and not likely to be involved. 

Remember they relied more on turntables than electronic instruments. They'd loop the drums off records or record with real drummers. 
##
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhMCeWFeWTM

1974, skip a minute or two in. 

not hiphop, but dem drum machine and synths. 

electronic music has been around since the ~1920's, although it only started to take off in popular music near the end of the 60's. 
##
Any chance you can provide examples of some 1920s electronic music? I'd love to hear it.
##
it's a bit difficult finding recordings on youtube. this one is 1937.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrYgm5MML58

and a demonstration. No idea from when. the instrument he's playing he invented in the late 20's. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Y-75BI3xY

this recording is made much, much more recently, but it uses only 1920's-1930's electronic instruments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVfhzLl5C9U

##
Top one is Ondes Martenot and the second is the theremin.  Here is a video of one of the greatest theremin players (she helped Theremin develop the instrument in fact):

Her artistry is astounding. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSzTPGlNa5U

Edited to say it is one of the only (if not the only) instrument played entirely without touching any part of the instrument.  The hand movements in air break radio signals which gives the pitch etc.
##
Check out this guy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgard_Var%C3%A8se
##
In a class called Black Popular Culture that I took in university, we learned that changes in the educational system routed a lot of young black people to learn a trade and subsequently many leaned the basics of becoming an electrician. Then when impromptu hip-hop concerts would be on in the streets, these guys could pry open the boxes at the base of streetlights to access the wires and use them to power all the speakers and other musical equipment.
##
"The Bronx is Burning" is an excellent book. As a New Yorker, born in 1991 and raised in the Giuliani/Bloomberg era, it was hard for me to even imagine the city described in that book. Really gives you a sense of respect for how drastically better NYC is today.

In this particular context, it was really remarkable how orderly the city was during Sandy, the ensuing multiple day blackout, and the gas shortage. There were, IIRC, a couple isolated reports of looting in the Rockaways and in Red Hook, but that was really it in terms of crime making a bad situation worse.

For contrast, just imagine the storm damage, flooding, mass blackouts going on for days, and hours long lines for gas, all happening in 1977...
##
Where in Hell's Kitchen are there abandoned properties?
##
you'll see them on the NW corner of 9th avenue and 37th stree. the buildings have been bought up by a developer over the years but there are one or two hold out familes that still occupy some apartments despite most of it being boarded up. When they eventually vacate (however that happens) then the buildings will be condemned and redeveloped.

##
I had no idea about this. Can you explain more? Who are these people? Just this one block?
##
There are only a few blocks on Manhattan like this, but it is really a trip to see abandoned buildings right next to high-rises and seemingly normal storefronts. There's a partially abandoned block on [8th Avenue and 46th Street](https://maps.google.com/?ll=40.759936,-73.987813&amp;spn=0.004323,0.021136&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.759931,-73.987821&amp;panoid=OFgBiF00JSFvOHIAFnDrrA&amp;cbp=11,283.34,,0,-10.23), which is interesting because that is the start of "Restaurant Row," a series of highly acclaimed restaurants on 46th Street between 8th and 9th Avenues.
##
This is the one block i'm aware of. the people have been living there a long while, several families i recall, and all immigrant. There are a handful of buildings scattered about south of the bus terminal that are in this condition, but this block stands out because most of the buildings are ready for condemnation, leaving a sizable footprint for new development in a highly sought-out area.
##
Thank you so much. In all honesty I don't think there has been something I wanted replied to more this year. You're awesome. Thank you. 
##
:)
##
There's a building on the SW corner of 57th and 9th that I think is abandoned. Certainly looks abandoned.
##
I think you're talking about the Windermere, which opened in 1881 and is the city's second-oldest large apartment building. During the early 20th Century, it served as a boarding house for young working women, and was later converted into SRO's. Parts of the building have been abandoned since the 70s, and there were people squatting in it until recently. It was bought for development in 2011 and only recently has construction started, and it seems like it will become a [hotel with some residences](http://newyorkyimby.com/2013/09/renovation-imminent-400-west-57th-street.html). 
##
The fact that we got out of that detroitesque death spiral is amazing
##
The two situations seem rather different to me;  not in policy response but in the actual challenges facing each city.  A key difference would seem to be that the troubled years for one of NYC's key industries (namely, finance) in the 1970s were clearly temporary, when compared to the boom years of the '80s (and the health of the finance industry was influenced by factors much bigger than NYC policy decisions).  By contrast, the decline of domestic manufacturing (which occupied a similar role for Detroit) was definitely not a short-term dip kind of thing, and Detroit's consistent decline reflects that.
##
There's the added bit of political corruption, as well. As someone who lives in Detroit, though, I'll say I was quite impressed to see where NYC was and where it is now. State take over, thousands of abandoned buildings, everyone moving away, and intense violence? Sure sounded familiar!
##
My understanding is that the mismanagement was what made them entirely unable to handle the loss of the core of their economic status as one of America's golden cities. Many other cities have managed to pivot towards other industries (for an older example, nobody comes to San Francisco to pan for gold anymore, they come for tech and shipping and finance and...). 
##
I would point out that while Detroit's situation is now quite dire, it's municipal incompetence is quite recent. (Detroit's finances in the 70s and 80s)[http://www.freep.com/interactive/article/20130915/NEWS01/130801004/Detroit-Bankruptcy-history-1950-debt-pension-revenue] were not as bad as popularly described today.
##
Didn't Detroit fail because it put all its eggs in one sinking basket? In contrast when I think of New York I don't think of finance as the "big job providing" industry. How does a finance company provide a benefit for the economy as a whole?
##
New York City has a corporation tax. Financial companies pay a lot. Without them, we'd be in bad shape.
##
Finance is one of the largest employers in New York. http://www.labor.ny.gov/stats/PDFs/Significant-Industries-New-York-City.pdf
##
That says that the only reason it's so significant is because they earn five times as much as the average worker. 
##
Detroiter here.  Local governance is the most openly corrupt in the free world.  Race politics dictate everything in the metro area, and rarely for the better.
##
New York's renaissance is often attribute to Giuliani. Do you think this is fair? Would it also be fair to attribute some of the problems the city saw in the 70's to the mayor at the time?
##
Giuliani was, much like Bill Clinton, in the right place at the right time. 

Dinkins made huge strides in his 4 years that really started to take off under Giuliani's first term. Dinkins' safe street program caused crime to plummet, he finally worked to get homeless off the streets, his deal with the USTA brought in a massive influx of cash, and he finally made long term contracts with most unions. 

That's not to say that Guiliani did nothing. He further cracked down on crime, was an advocate for the immigrant community, and helped further LGBT causes. He also was a strong advocate for bringing tourism back to the city that really took off.
##
Crime saw a precipitous drop nationwide in the 90s.  Do you know of anything showing a greater than proportional drop in crime for NYC that could be attributed to local initiatives?
##
Check out the book The City That Became Safe.

NYC experienced the largest crime drop of any city in recorded history. Something like 80% drop in violent crime.

It's now America's safest city with a population over 250,000.

Wrap your head around that for a minute...
##
The chart in [this blog post](http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/11/no-crime-not-going-start-soaring-under-bill-de-blasio) seems to show NYC's violent drop as similar to other big US cities, and possibly slower than LA's drop. So I'm sort of skeptical of that claim, unless non-violent crime dropped more quickly.
##
You have to be careful with the definition of violent crime. There are other charts that depict New York City's crime index plummeting like a rock since the late 80s.

But I agree with the premise of the blog post. Crime is not going to skyrocket due to a new mayor. Crime doesn't switch on and off like a light switch.
##
In the book Freakonomics the author attributes the drop in crime to the Roe v Wade decision in the 70's. Because of abortion, a bunch of poor, fatherless, with drug-addicted mothers to which babies weren't born and hence committing crimes 15 to 20 years later. I didn't state it very eloquently but that's HIS theory. 
##
Yeah that was in freakonomics and I think malcolm gladwell has said the same thing.  But I think it has been pretty thoroughly debunked.  The leading theories I've heard tend to be stiffer prison sentences, economic growth, unleaded fuel, and some other things. 
##
Except it turns out that Canada and Western Europe had similar dips in the 90's and they didn't necessarily have all or any of those things.
##
There is a very interesting and plausible connection between the [elimination of leaded petrol and crime](http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/lead-crime-link-gasoline) that touches on whether Giuliani's policies were to thank for the drop in crime rates in NYC.

&gt; So Nevin dove in further, digging up detailed data on lead emissions and crime rates to see if the similarity of the curves was as good as it seemed. It turned out to be even better: In a 2000 paper (PDF) he concluded that if you add a lag time of 23 years, lead emissions from automobiles explain 90 percent of the variation in violent crime in America. Toddlers who ingested high levels of lead in the '40s and '50s really were more likely to become violent criminals in the '60s, '70s, and '80s.
##
Yeah, I've read the two ungated papers cited in that article. [This one](http://www.ricknevin.com/uploads/Nevin_2000_Env_Res_Author_Manuscript.pdf) was interesting, but not terribly convincing.  [This one](http://www.nber.org/papers/w13097) was much better, I haven't found a free version of [this one](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412012000566), so I don't know about it.  That's one good theory, but I don't know that it is widely agreed on yet. 

That may be part of it, but there are other competing options and some timelines don't matchup.  Europe didn't ban leaded gas until well into the 80s ([source](http://www.csmonitor.com/1983/0909/090948.html)) whereas the US banned it in the mid 70s.  Yet there's not a decade lag in falling crime in Europe - they saw similar drops in crime in the 90s as the US.  

I'm not sure there is a leading contender as an explanation.
##
Freakonomics made a suggestion that the legalisation of abortion approx 20 years earlier also had an effect on the drop in crime, by essentially removing the criminals before they were born.   Possibly a bit simplistic, but something to consider. 
##
Actually, this view has been heavily contested from a number of angles.

The Freakonomics theory is based on the assumption that the children that were aborted would have been born into a family that could not or didn't want to support them, circumstances that make it more likely for the child to commit a crime later in his life.

However, empirical analysis shows that that among pregnant women that did not plan to become a parent at that stage of their life, those that do chose to abort are more realistic, more disciplined and more provident. They achieve higher grades in school, finish school more often and are less likely to be on welfare than those that decide to keep the baby anyway. (Joyce 2004)

While it is true that delinquency rates among unwanted children are higher, a better explanation for this statistic seems to be unwanted pregnancies are more common among women that live in a high delinquency social environment. The influence of peer-groups on individual criminal behaviour has been repeatedly shown to be bigger than that of the individuals family life. (Harris 2008)

Additionally, the theory has been attacked because it posits a chain of causal relations over the course of 20 years that disregard other explanations that are at least as likely to have influenced the crime rate. There's lots of literature on this, and one thing that is pointed out fairly often is that the liberal states that were the first to legalize abortion, were also the first to see the rise and fall of the crack epidemic and the accompanying spike in crime rates. (e.g. Zimring 2007, Lott &amp; Whitley 2007)

Steven Pinker describes the development of crime rates in modern societies in an easy to read and very informative way in his book "The Better Angels of Our Nature", he also adresses the development of crime rates in the United States in detail in Chapter 3. I highly recommend it if you're interested in the topic.

There's also the theory put forth by Rick Nevin that lead exposure in childhood can increase the likelihood of violent crime later in life. He points out that around the world there are similar spikes in violent crime that plummet drastically ~20 years after communities start to ban the use of lead in gasoline and household products.

But the full paper is behind a paywall. 
##
Interesting side information. My 1955 encyclopedia states that the top three uses of lead were lead paint, lead pipes, and lead foil (like aluminum foil). 
##
It didn't list tetraethyllead? I'd guess that TEL would be far nastier in terms of lead exposure, even if perhaps more lead was used for paint, pipes, and foil.
##
The article was probably dumbed down. Or it was the TOP three uses. 
##
Contested conclusions but highly readable book. 
##
These things didn't just happen as a matter of course. Robert Moses spent much of the 60's explicitly trying to "remake" the city by driving out the dirtier parts of its manufacturing base. Then the disaterous RAND study convinced the Lindsay administration to close fire houses in high fire risk areas like the Bronx while opening new stations in places they weren't needed. Setting the stage for the conflagration that was to come. 

Yes the economic slowdown of the 1970's exacerbated earlier errors, but the roots of NYCs fall largely intentional decisions made by policy makers a decade earlier. 
##
Why did RAND tell them I do that?
##
This is a somewhat opinionated view but they get the key facts right. http://nypost.com/2010/05/16/why-the-bronx-burned/

[This](http://www.fireengineering.com/articles/print/volume-165/issue-8/features/fire-department-performance-management-is-public-policy-on-the-map.html) seems like a good explanation.

Another book worth checking out if you're interested in musical subculture: [Love Goes to Buildings on Fire: Five Years in New York That Changed Music Forever](http://lovegoestobuildingsonfire.com). You mostly hear about punk and hip-hop now, but we shouldn't forget that period also had the birth of salsa and disco, and an incredibly vital avant garde jazz scene. 
##
Thanks for an excellent suggestion! I got it for kindle and it looks to be a great read. 
##
Glad to see this here. Great book.

Also the advanced equipment that became available to the avantgarde jazz scene brought it really further

The irony is that among the cuts were dozens of FDNY fire stations over a 5 year period in the 70s, ["and the closings helped kick off a firestorm that created the infamous burned-out Bronx neighborhoods that the likes of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and even Mother Theresa came to gawk at."](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/06/faced_with_cutbacks_the_fdny_t.html)
##
A sidenote to the last part: it is not only you who would argue that it was the starting point of the hip-hop movement. B-Boy Life regularly holds seminars/workshops where he describes the 77 blackout as the starting point due to the heavy looting of electronics stores. This led to a surge in the prevalence of DJ's by tenfold+ since the equipment required for DJing became available (to use a neutral word).

There is more information in the book [Can't Stop Won't Stop](http://www.amazon.co.jp/Cant-Stop-Wont-History-Generation/dp/0312425791) which also elaborates on the teenagers getting paid to burn down their own apartments since the insurance money was worth more than the land the buildings were standing on. It also discusses how the new Cross Bronx Expressway was one of the starting points of the decay of that neighborhood.
##
Also the 77 blackout was a record hot summer that was dominated by "Son of Sam" serial killer, and the Disco/Cocaine Era was in full swing at Studio 76.
##
Studio 54, you mean.
##
&gt; some building owners paid teenagers to set their buildings on fire so they could collect the insurance money. 

Can't find my source on this but I remember someone (possibly one of those 70's NYC rockers like Patti Smith or Lou Reed?) talking about how at some point burning buildings just became weather.
##
I'm probably too late but can you give more detail on how they managed to turn the city around?
##
one big reason was recovering from the fiscal crisis. this was done a number of ways, but the deal brokered between the muncipal assistance corporation - which was charged with refinancing the city's debt with favorable terms - and the new york city teachers' union helped precipitated the turn around. what happened was that the city was hours away from default, and several major figures got together hashed out an 11th hour deal where the teachers' union bought $150 million in bonds to keep the city afloat. after that numerous other deals, mostly done through refinancing and union negotiations, further alleviated the financial troubles, then a rebound in the economy helped keep the recovery going.
##
[Can't Stop Wont Stop](http://www.amazon.com/Cant-Stop-Wont-History-Generation/dp/0312425791) is a great book detailing how Hip Hop culture rose from the hell that was New York to define a generation of youth.
##
How bad was the recession that it turned NYC into a shithole for so long?  Were other cities affected similarly?  What was it like pre-1969?  I see things like the iconic WW2 Times Square photo and then not really much between then and Saturday Nigh Fever-era NYC.  
##
&gt;(which was furthered by the 1977 blackout, where young MCs got access to more advanced equipment) 

Do you have a source on that?

I found the anecdotes in Caro's The Power Broker really interesting. He brought up how in the 60's NYC had a huge influx of incredibly poor African Americans from the south as part of the Great Migration. Millions of desperately poor, uneducated, and often illiterate blacks who had previously known only absolute poverty and were often raised as sharecroppers flooded into Northeastern cities to escape the brutal racism of the south.

The way he tells it in The Power Broker, a lot of NYC neighborhoods were already somewhat integrated. Working class and middle class whites and jews lived alongside African Americans who had been in the North for decades and were educated and had middle/working class values and jobs. They were neighbors and their kids played together and, at least in Caro's telling, racism wasn't a huge problem among the working/middle class of the city.

But then these desperately poor, uneducated African Americans from the south, which is also quite culturally dissimilar, started showing up and soon after vandalism and crime and visible poverty started making otherwise-stable neighborhoods much less appealing to the middle/working classes. This was also around the time Robert Moses was laying down highways all across the 5 boroughs and making it much easier for people to flee to the suburbs.

There are countless factors but I thought Caro made a compelling argument about the reasons for white flight and how it was impacted by The Great Migration.
##
Are most cities alike? Can you compare a lot of city policies or issues with say, a county, a state or a nation?  Do cities normally go through growths and spurts? Are some cities uniqely different from others? How does NYC compare to city-state entities like say, hong kong or singspore. Or small nations like belgium or a saudi principality? Thanks!

The abortion link has been debunked so many times over that it's not even worth arguing over anymore. For example, the same dropped occurred in other countries that did not change their abortion laws.

Did the flourishing new cultures ultimately lead to NYC's success in the 90s?

[This thread](http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=402544), which collates a number of Jacob Holdt 's photographs of his time in New York is fascinating and really gives a visual indication of quite how terrible it got.   I highly recommend following the links in that thread.

I got his book [American Pictures](http://www.amazon.com/American-Pictures-Personal-Journey-Underclass/dp/8798170201) from the library a few years back and was blown away by his narrative of his journey through America. His vagabond philosophy was incredible. Highly recommend this to everyone.
##
Thanks I was going to link to these they are amazing, really demonstrates the state the city was in
##
Yes.

Crime did skyrocket, and while one may claim that this was the case with other cities, New York had been perceived as relatively safe before. Many artists that had made New York their home bailed on the city as it became more dangerous. This changed the character of the city.

Poor economic conditions also hit New York harder than other places. City governments balanced their budgets on the back of the poor, most notably by closing down mental institutions housing Vietnam vets can thereby creating a new and infamous homeless problem in the city.

Some commentators here have claimed the "bronx is burning" saying refers to ethnic unrest in the city. It does not. It refers to an actual time when landlords in the Bronx set fire to their own buildings to collect on insurance since property values had plummeted.

While New York follows national trendlines in terms of crime, remember that the effect are exaggerated by the condensed nature of the city. Tourism declined during this period because the crime in the city was unavoidable.  It was at this time that New York began to court tourists directly by calling it the Big Apple and what not. (it had not been called that in decades.)

Do you have any sources for anything in your comment?

Yeah but it was also used as a metaphor.

This may have as much to do with [American filmmaking in the 1970s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hollywood) as with New York itself. Can any experts expand on that side of the question?

[Check out the statistics for crime in NY.](http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/nycrime.htm)

There were 58,802 violent crimes in 1965, in 1975 there were 155,187. 28,182 robberies in 1965, in 1975 there were 93,499. The stats are similar for other types of crime. Other cities did not see the same level of increase in crime.

A tripling of crime, both serious and petty, within a decade and at the same time the city was not doing well financially, with budgets in the red and deficits. Health, fire and police departments suffered substantial budget cuts. Other cities in the US did better, both crimewise and financially.

&gt;Health, fire and police departments suffered substantial budget cuts.

To further your point, I can only imagine the amount of unreported crime that occurred in New York at that time, considering just how stretched the resources of the police force were.

Crime is still underreported in New York.  Beginning in 1995, the NYPD began tracking crime statistics with a program called [COMPSTAT.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compstat)  The natural consequence of live, fresh crime rate data was its use as a metric of policing success.  The pressure this placed on precincts to show improvement has resulted in overreporting of petty crime (to demonstrate policework) and underreporting of serious crime (to show success.)

[Here's](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/09/us-crime-newyork-statistics-idUSBRE82818620120309) a Reuters article on the phenomenon.  Unfortunately, the internal NYPD report on the topic that the article refers to has not, to my knowledge, been made public.

I would counsel caution in relying on underreporting when making relative judgments based on the numbers.  Just as there's no way to know how bad underreporting was in the 70's, there's no way to know how bad it is now.

&gt; Just as there's no way to know how bad underreporting was in the 70's, there's no way to know how bad it is now.

The Bureau of Justice Statistics has been performing the [National Crime Victimization Survey](http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&amp;iid=245) since the early 1970s; if cops were ignoring crime rates, there would be a drop in the Uniform Crime Reports numbers (local police departments reporting their statistics to the feds) but not the NCVS; it's a tool specifically designed to measure underreporting.

The DOJ [publishes "Criminal Victimization" annually](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv12.pdf); see Figure 1 for the 'money graph'.

For a more New York City-specific view, [this is an analysis of burglary, robbery and aggravated assault over the period 1980-2003 in New York City](http://www.crimetrends.com/id8.html). The UCR trends (which map well to COMPSTAT numbers) are quite similar to the NCVS trends for property crimes, but are a lot squigglier with reference to aggravated assault. It would certainly be *interesting* to do the same analysis now, a decade later.
##
That's extremely interesting data, thank you.

That link is for New York State, not New York City, and I was referring to murder rates, not all crime rates.

For comparison between New York City, you can look at the homicide rates for similarly sized cities such as Chicago or Los Angeles, which suffered especially from [racist housing covenants](http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/landofsunshine/portraits/a-southern-california-dream-deferred.html) and the Watts Riots.

It's important to evaluate the differences in crime due to these historical factors, if we are to evaluate our history at all.

Hi, I'm late to this party, but from having lived in NYC for decades, would make a few points somewhat in contrast to the story painted here so far:

There were certainly a few years in the mid 1970s when city services were really at risk. But generally speaking the city came back pretty quickly once a forward looking plan for financial recovery, along with adequate day-to-day management (Koch), was in place. The city was "back" by the early 1980s- remember that this was when the term "yuppie" (young urban/upwardly-mobile professional) was coined, about the rapid growth of a new creative class in NYC. There was also an enormous return to wealth of the financial class in the mid-1980s, as described in movies like Wall Street and fiction from folks like Bret Easton Ellis. 

However, there was a subsequent deterioration in the later 1980s and early 1990s- due to drugs (crack), AIDS, financial fallout from the failures of the junk bond kings, and larger macro-economic problems. A lot of money disappeared, and by the early 1990s the city was returning to a precarious place. 

This is when Rudy was elected mayor. 

About Rudy- people I think misunderstand- and miscredit- Rudy's tenure, but the "clean it up" phrase can be taken quite literally, in both good and bad ways. 

What Rudy did that was very new and had a huge impact was to just pay enormous, detailed attention to visible signs of deterioration, under what was called the "broken windows" theory. 

He targeted- yes, broken windows- graffiti, classes of businesses and really any kind of outdoor activity that could be seen as disconcerting or threatening to delicate sensitivities. In his later years, even chewing gum and jaywalking were targets (no joke). The "Disneyfication" of Times Square was only one of many "clean up" projects of this kind. 

But Rudy was not an architect of change, more just a custodian of it. He was a one-trick micro-manager, and his lack of strategic capability is why he has failed so dramatically in subsequent public endeavors, like running for President. 

I would not credit him fully on crime. Certainly, as he was a former prosecutor, Rudy was of course incredibly police friendly. But much of the decline in various sorts of more serious crime is likely better attributed simply to the elimination of lead from gasoline, as widely documented elsewhere by folks like Kevin Drum.

Still, he came to the city at a pivotal point. For most of post-WW2, NYC has been a first world city with a third world energy, freedom, and uncertainty. After Rudy, NYC has been sanitized, homogenized, and re-commercialized, seen an enormous return of tourists and families, while losing a lot of the sense of creative freedom.  

This "professionalization" of course has only grown under Bloomberg, under whom we now see a huge rise in the "creative workers leaving NYC" category, because it is so expensive and so exhausting to be "on" all the damn time here. I read in progressive Bill de Blasio's enormous victory in the most recent mayoral election a deep, underlying emotional need for a break, rebalancing, release.

TLDR: I felt compelled to respond because the blurb that NYC was a cesspool until Rudy is too far from the more interesting truth of what has been gained, and lost.


##
This is an awesome answer, thank you. Is there anyway you could expand more or post some links to the lead in gasoline part that you touched on? That seems really fascinating
##
Thank you- [here's] (http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/lead-crime-link-gasoline) one of Kevin's pieces that touches on the lead and crime link, and also delves specifically into the NYC narrative. 

[Search Mother Jones] (http://www.motherjones.com/search/apachesolr_search/lead%20gasoline) for his many other pieces on this topic, most of link to the underlying research.

Thank you!

I lived in New York briefly in 1977 and 78. It was an absolute shithole. The only movie to portray it accurately was thee Warriors. I'm glad I was there and I'm glad I left. The fact that it was changed into the strong city it is today amazes me. Those responsible deserve credit because that bankrupt pice of shit city being revitalized never seemed possible to me at the time.
##
Can anyone enunciate on why it was a "shithole"? 
I haven't seen any movies about New York in the 70's.
##
Was watching Serpico last night.  That's a great place to start.  Or try French Connection or any number of other movies I can't think of right now...

Ahh.  Taxi Driver and Saturday Night Fever.
