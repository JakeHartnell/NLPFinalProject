Hey man, great video. Quick question though. Those bolts will surely not be 
tight enough to keep the bar from moving under high force. Why put bolts on 
each side when it'll just allow movement in the bar and allow less of the 
force to be transferred/absorbed? Personally, I have an OEM three point 
strut bar on the front that bolts to the firewall and has no pivot points.﻿
##
Is there an advantage for strut brace over strut mount vs. strut brace 
connecting to the side of the tower?﻿
##
God bless you for these videos!! I'm on a marathon!!!!! from diffuser 
videos, to CAI, exhaust everything man!!!! keep it up!!! so like what's 
next? seafoam explained?
##
 can you make a video explain how swag bar work 
##
i feel so stupid right now i thought those bars were to protect the engine 
from a blow i saw those bars all the time i the fast and furious movies lol 
thanks man i always learn from your videos your helping me get smarter at 
this stuff
##
While on track in my E36 M3 (was running very sticky rubber) I cracked a 
windshield after negotiating a quick right-left-right section of track...in 
video you could see the crack form and grow as the chassis twisted left and 
right. Adding a sub-frame brace and a strut bar significantly reduced 
chassis flex...I haven't broken a windshield since. 
##
I'm not an engineer. I am a retired automotive technician of 44 years. I 
used to race cars. I added a strut bar to a car I'd driven every day and 
raced after two years. After the first race, the windshield cracked. I had 
customers who installed strut bars and experienced the same. One of those 
cars was a VW GTI that, as I stated, cracked three windshields. In my 
circle of racing acquaintances, it became common knowledge that adding a 
strut bar to a car w/glued-in w/shield would likely suffer. 
##
From what I've heard﻿ 2 point strut bars do very little to stiffen the 
chassis. I believe 3 point strut bars that anchor the bar actually have an 
effect.
##
That particular car may have benefited from a subframe and frame tying 
front subframe brace. Convertibles experience this as cowl shake. Like one 
from Mason Engineering .ne t
##
Wouldn't a strut bar reduce the likelihood of a windshield failure? If the 
WS is a stressed member, the addition of a SB will reduce the amount of 
stress applied to that WS. 
##
Excellent! Except double wishbone suspensions are load bearing at the top 
also. The full weight of the car is transferred from the body to the lower 
control arms through this point in both designs.
##
Sway bars cause a much greater impact on vehicle dynamics than strut bars, 
so if done properly, a sway bar. 
##
What would be more beneficial from a general perspective (as well as if I 
was to do some autocross events). Front/Rear sway bar or the strut bar? 
Thanks
##
Good video
##
I suppose. It's likely a case by case (car by car) scenario as the stresses 
aren't going to pass the same way in all vehicles. 
##
The windshield is glue to the frame, which turns it into a stressed member. 
When the front of the car is stiffened elsewhere, it transfers the stress 
to the windshield/frame. Something's gotta give. Stress cracks that begin 
in the edges of the glass is the result. I knew one guy who went through 
three windshields. Replaced the heavier sway bar with a stock unit and the 
cracks stopped. He was one of a handful who experienced the problem.
##
"greatly increase the chances that your windshield will crack" You realize 
quite a few vehicles come with these from the factory right? The items 
aren't very connected. Care to explain the logic? 
##
Be aware that installing a strut bar will greatly increase the chances that 
your windshield will crack. I've seen it a number of times.
##
Grammar fix now commas help you
##
They all leave feeling a bit stiffer.
##
An accountant, a writer and a doctor walk into a strut bar, and none of 
them know what they got themselves into.
##
Integras dont have double.wish dey dj ot sin dj le bone only ndx n orelude 
have double wishbones
##
Likely no, you would want either stiffer springs, a stiffer anti-roll bar, 
or to raise your vehicle to fix this.
##
Would this reduce roll around a corner? I have a lowered Integra and my 
wheel rubs on a hard corner, would this reduce rub?
##
Yes.
##
do u have gray hairs?
##
I would just say make sure everything's tightened well and there shouldn't 
be much movement. 
##
Hey EE! Is it better to have the struts adjusted to be pulling in or 
pushing out? This seems to be the flaw with adjustable struts, they can 
move more than the chassis flexes.
##
on a really bumpy road you loose ride comfort since that the car is too 
rigid. my own experience I have front and rear strut bar plus a lower tie 
bar on bumpy roads the whole car follow instead that one side is affected 
since the suspension are fully connected you won't lose a lot but you will 
feel it but you got a better handling wich I like!
##
Nice vid man!
##
strut bars are great..the one in your video would not be used on a race car 
since it has two joints..as rigid static strut bar would account for 
chassis twist..like when you go around a turn or go over a bump.. good vid 
##
Possibly slightly less. 
##
Would your control arm bushings/sway bar links etc... take on more stress 
with a strut bar?
##
Minimizing flex is always a good thing in suspension. If any flex does 
occur during movement, the suspension geometry then gets thrown off as well 
thus decreasing overall handling. Good video!!
##
thanx man, good to have u im going to be askin u a lot of anoying questions
##
Actually, depeding on the suspension you use, i would affect comfort! Our 
Legacy BG5 Wagon, With Impreza GT Struts and Coils, with Front and Rear 
Strut Bars, is waaaay diferent on confort with, and without them! Anyway, i 
really liked the video!. Congrats.
##
You may be thinking of a sway bar, strut bars won't have much (if any) 
influence on understeer/oversteer, where as sway bars certainly will. 
##
If it's paired with a rear strut bar, otherwise just stiffening the front 
may induce understeer.
##
I've got a question, while discussing the potential value in a strut bar on 
a double wishbone, you bring up the fact that the shock will be compressed 
during a hard turn. Of course this is true, so it makes me reconsider your 
explanation of the macpherson strut. You explain that a hard turn would 
cause a rotational force upon the lower control arm, pulling the strut from 
its tower. What about the compression of the strut? Wouldn't it be pushing 
the strut into the tower? Good videos regardless.
##
does a bmw e30 drift better with a SB?
##
With all that momentum getting transferred wouldn't that decrease the life 
expectancy of a strut bar
##
Won't affect comfort. 
##
Strut bar is a good to have? How about the driver's and passenger's 
comfort? Does it affect that?
##
Oh true, i didn't really think of that. 
##
Oh ok. Interesting, thanks.
##
Nice video! About the rear strut bar, I think the main difference is that 
it often goes through the boot which is really impractical! ;-) Yeah there 
are people who do care about the practicality of a boot! (I'm not one of 
those do not worry! ;-) )
##
If it was noticeably negative camber, it's just for show. In all likelihood 
the handling would be worse and the tire would wear unevenly. 
##
Somewhat related; I saw a vintage corvette with negative camber on the back 
wheels. Would this camber potentially help keep the outside tire planted 
when taking a tight corner at a high speed and reduce over steer because of 
the friction trying to pull the wheel inward (therefore the tire may be 
closer to flat with the pavement in that situation than without camber)?
##
correct, to strut your stuff.
##
Correct, to increase chassis rigidity. 
##
So the function is just to share the force to the other side of the car?
##
That would likely cause uneven wear when you don't need it (ie going 
straight). 
##
So, to make up for a strut bar, you can implement two or three negative 
degrees of camber, to gain more traction whilst cornering?
##
genius I tell you 
##
your videos are great! you present difficult auto concepts in a format 
that's very easy to understand. i've learned more from you in the past few 
days about how cars work by watching your videos than ever before.
##
as for the gsr, type r, and civic si come with strut bars, the strut bar is 
mounted along the strut tower area as we all know but its not mounted onto 
the actual strut tower itself to support the struts. u have to drill into 
the tower to mount these struts. with these type vs the ones that are made 
to mount right onto the strut, which is better?
##
Probably would be best to physically connect to two strut towers, the way 
it's done with the Type r, etc..
##
I will indeed be doing this. Thanks!
##
I suppose it would be possible if they were weak enough. 
##
I'd love to see a video of you modifying your own car with all the parts 
that you've been sent. Or just an aftermath video on your car after being 
modded with the parts.
##
is there any change of snapping strut studs due to stress of cornering hard?
##
I believe air springs are much costlier. But you can alter your ride height 
in a matter of seconds rather than taking an hour or so. 
##
i like this man.
##
Nice work :) Keep posting :)
##
what are the benefits of using air springs over coil-overs? which is better?
##
I've found a new purpose to my mechanical engineering studies: understand 
properly your videos haha! Having just started, I remember oh so well doing 
moments and forces last semester... Great video by the way, as always !! 
##
Nope.
##
You're very welcome, thanks for the kind words. 
##
Excellent explanation thanks
##
excellent videos, man. some of the best. you take some intimidating stuff 
and make it very easy to understand. thanks.
##
Will it makes the car more uncomfortable?
##
or too thick of a rear sway bar. Usually people don't want to get rid of 
the oversteer in an FF platform, though, as a tad of oversteer allows the 
car to rotate into sharp angles easier, it makes it handle much better. Of 
course it lowers the stability on quick turns at high speeds. As for the 
understeer, there's so many factors: Tire pressure, tire surface heat, sway 
bar size, body roll, struts/valving, and the driver for example.You can 
make the best setup FF car push if you drive it wrong.
##
You can get stiffer spring without changing the ride height. But if you 
want to go around a corner quickly I'd look at your tires first.
##
Awesome. I love mine, haven't really started doing anything to it, though I 
plan on turning into a track car once I get another car. That's when the 
fun starts!
##
How* -_-'
##
So far Redline360 and Yonaka have been very kind to help out with videos. I 
do believe this trend will continue as long as all goes well. 
##
I believe double wishbone type suspensions allow for maintaining the 
geometry of the wheel across a wider range of travel than MacPherson 
struts, without compromising the wheel camber. 
##
do strut bars make the struts last longer?
##
Thanks for your lesson man ! That's great, However I do have some doubts 
which I hope you would clarify for me. So based on your explanation, I 
understand that strut bar connects the right and the left side strut towers 
together hence distributes the forces. But what about 4 points strut bars ? 
More contact points = more rigidity ? How would the front strut bar affect 
the understeer and oversteer ? Currently experiencing both US and OS. (FF & 
MacPerson equipped) Thanks in advance. 
##
i see a b18a 
##
awesome video! I added some bars to my old pontiac 99' grand am (boat) and 
felt an instant response with corners Struts are not to be over looked! 
##
Did you learn most of these things at university?
##
Hey I was wondering if I take off my muffler and keep it straight piped 
would it increase horse power?
##
I was really hoping you were sponsored or endorsed by a parts manufacturer.
##
Great vid
##
First question, not really. Don't know much about Bose suspensions. If 
you're referring to the "active" part of the suspension, it is unrelated to 
the strut bar.
##
Search my channel for "anti-roll bar - explained"
##
You are so awesome for making these videos. I dont understand how youre so 
nice to take time from your day to teach people about cars.. i highly 
respect you.
##
Love this chan, but my english is sometimes too bad for understand all :D.
##
I'm leaning towards an STI, but I want to hear about the new model. 
##
what ever you plan to purchase. get OBD1 enjoy every one of your videos.
##
I would be glad to take your lottery money. :)
##
No, I have a video on anti-roll bars if you'd like to watch. 
##
Do strut bars play a role in comfortability of the car? What is your 
opinion of Bose suspensions? Do they use strut bars in their 
configurations/ Thank You for the answers
##
I told you before the 99 integra LS was my first real car. I had the 
original sypder rims and everything. I ended up selling it because I racked 
up 20+ tickets like a retard but I did pretty much the same as you. My mod 
list: Optima yellow top batt. Skunk2 strut bar Skunk2 pro series intake 
manifold Venom Fuel rail Custom JDM carbon fiber intake bigger Throttle 
body... SKunk 2 as well forgot size though port 99 si head vtec frank swap 
tit. internals killer cams ect... one of my fav cars. 
##
So is a strut bar the same as an anti roll bar?
##
And recently I downgraded to stiffer shock absorbers and shorter coil 
springs, see how it goes, but still no front sway bar. Thanks for your info 
man, appreciate it.
##
so if i ever win the lottery and need someone to build my custom car, im 
going to call you first :) 
##
would you say it's worth the money to put a strut bar on a 91 Integra gs. 
It is also pretty much slammed too, idk if that matters.
##
no its not.
##
Tell if this is a correct analysis. Strut towers are connected to the body 
of the car regardless of macphearson or Double-A. However, they can flex a 
little within ( it looks like there are bushings but there will be body 
flex). This means that that the force the strut bar transfers is moresoe 
due to the rotation of the strut than any linear movement. 
##
Thanks for another great lesson! Thumbs up.
##
A triangle is the﻿ strongest shape in physics, the firewall completes that 
triangle and greatly reduces flex.
##
Correct, the MacPherson strut is load bearing of the forces from lateral 
acceleration, where as a double-wishbone handles the vast majority of the 
forces through the control arms. Of course, the weight of the car, bumps, 
and weight transfer by cornering still put additional pressure on the 
coils, thus a force on the strut tower. 
##
Anti-roll bar is a torsion bar that connects at the bottom of the vehicle. 
It works on slightly different principles. Check out his video on anti-roll 
bar in the suspension section. 
##
Can you make a video explaining how brake cooling works through a car?
##
It must feel great having big companies like that give you components, 
lucky guy! 
##
you're awesome, i love your vids!
##
Depends how much force it actually sees. As it's a double wishbone 
suspension they may be fine as is. 
##
Thanks a bunch. Cheers !
##
DC4 integra. 
##
Why OBD1?
##
haha im lucky you replied, i don't want the internet screaming at me :( 
what year sti were you leaning on by the way?
##
Can you explain the diferent kind of pistons please.
##
Btw you have AMAZING videos. Naturally an amazing explainer hahaha
##
depends on the car and u have to tune it...ur car will lose its back 
pressure when you make it straight pipe, therefore it has to be tuned. If u 
have a a ricer and just want the sound go ahead, but for real performance 
they sell kits for that called exhaust system, so that it will pass 
emissions at the same time make horsepower...i am just talking out of 
experience...anyone correct me if i am wrong...my friend made his honda 
straight pipe. sound like its going 100mph when its only doing 30.lol
##
With all due respect. WHY don't you install the parts on your car? Or do 
you feel that will under mine the channel with preferential treatment.
##
What about your master?
##
what kind of course did you take to learn al these things? was it at a 
university or or some sort of different course? thanks.
##
Thank you!
##
Check out my video "why do convertibles weigh more." It's old haha, but I 
cover the basics. 
##
So basically when you say European Suspension System you can plausibly 
think of this? To wit it adds rigidity to the flame ameliorating torsional 
forces, absorbs vertical thrust (think pothole.) 
##
Question!: So during conering, the strut bar experiences tension as its 
holding the chassis together, but under a bump, its under compression? 
Also, does a strut bar control the balance of a car? or is that a sway bar? 
And finally, i heard that strut bars are useless unless they are connected 
to the firewall or more than 2 points.
##
that last sentance makes me want to shoot his honda...Your mostly right 
though. I would personally leave the exhaust alone unless your adding a 
turbo. If you want hp on the cheap, get different tires.
##
Check out the "FAQs" link on my "about" page on my channel. 
##
Confusing, but I will try to understand! Great video! :)
##
This is my favorite channel on YouTube.
##
Do all cars have strut towers? If not, then are you boned and can't install 
a sway bar?
##
Well, you want it to be as small and light as possible, while still 
managing to link the two bars without compromise. What the perfect balance 
is, I do not know. Would have to use some strain gauges.
##
I want to make one fro my old Alfetta. You cant buy them for my car but it 
shouldnt be too hard to make. any suggestions on the tubes wall thickness?
##
and how about strut bars that also connect to the top of the firewall?
##
Amazing, thanks!
##
It doesn't act as a sway bar, it simply keeps the body a bit more stiff. 
Sway bars are used to reduce roll, which is not what strut bars are used 
for. I have a video on sway bars if you're curious. 
##
In an FF setup with MP's that's most likely coming from too tight of a rear 
end. What kind of suspension are you running and how thick is the rear 
sway? Your OS problems are most likely sway related...same for your US, 
most likely, but there's many more factors that affect that on FF..
##
No, anti roll bars connect the bottom of the chassis to the suspension
##
So with a double wishbone setup the strut bar acts as a secondary sway bar 
that links the shocks/springs together?
##
As long as the components are strong enough for the forces they see, it 
shouldn't matter too much. A single piece will likely be able to handle 
stresses better as it wont have as many sheer points. 
##
doesnt even matter. just remove bolts up top and put it on and tighten 
down. 
##
Meaning what do I have to do to fix this ? Rear sway is already there, 
optional package from the factory. I don't have the exact measurement 
however the sizes and shape are pretty much similar to the aftermarkets. 
But no front sway bar. For the suspension, I tried adjustable front and 
back but its too tight and slide out the tire, too tight I guess ? and 
during hard cornering, the tires floats ! So I added pillow ball on top of 
it, less but still. 
##
Can u do traction rods?
##
I wonder what'll happen if you don't have strut bar installed in your 
vehicle ;D
##
Because they serve different purposes. 
##
Dude you're a genius for explaining all these components so well
##
Will too stiff strut bars cause understeer?
##
I don't see it making a huge difference, unless there is considerable flex 
in the strut towers upon lowering the car back onto the ground. Regardless, 
if installed once lowered it will attempt to negate any force which differs 
from the car when it is stationary. The bar will experience compression and 
tension, so pre-loading it one direction (which could be the case if 
installed while lifted) may not always be best. Interesting question though 
- feel free to expand anyone...
##
It shouldn't affect the steering dynamics. Stiff is a good thing in this 
case. 
##
Non vtec FTW nice =)
##
if your getting sponsored now congrats man you deserve it. thanks so much 
always for making these videos entertaiing. if you were a teacher i sure as 
fuck wouldnt sleep. thanks again and keep up the good work!
##
Are you an engineer or a mechanic?
##
Not from rotation of the strut, but from forces passing to the strut 
(whether it be tension or compression). 
##
09 si, do i wanna a strut bar? worth the $?
##
It's funny who all those classes on moments and force body diagrams now 
come in handy
##
I wouldn't call it the "strongest shape in physics." If anything, that 
would be awarded to circles as they distribute stress the most evenly - 
hence the use of cylinders in many structural systems, and why you can 
stand on an empty soda can without it crushing. That said, triangles are a 
strong shape in 2d, as they don't allow for movement as easily (degress of 
freedom) like a square. 
##
Great stuff keep up the good work!
##
4 points just means the forces will be distributed more evenly, this is a 
good thing. Also, sway bars will have a much larger impact on 
understeer/oversteer - check out my video "anti-roll bars - explained" for 
more details. 
##
No I know how they work, but in the back if the bar is pushed enough on one 
side it will try to lift the other in a similar fashion to a sway bar.
##
Please do A video on water methanol please.
##
Hrm, it's difficult w/o knowing the platform entirely off-hand. Though if 
you go into any forum's (like if you have an integra, check out honda-tech 
for example, an SRT-4, check-out srtforums, etc.) autocross section and 
you'll find tons of people who know how to fix the problems on that 
particular platform. The oversteer is most likely caused by too tight of a 
rear, which can be caused by tighter valved struts in the rear (happens 
when people mis-match), too high spring rates, or continued
##
Hi, I have a question. Im driving an EG5 and something I notice is that my 
rear strut bar isnt very solid. When its mounted and I grab it in the 
middle and shake it, the bar starts to elasticly bend a bit. So the 
question is - does it still do what it is supposed to? From this video I 
assume that strut bars deal with push/pull forces only and not rotation 
momentum.
##
awesome video man. 
##
So wouldn't it be lighter to have a MacPherson and a strut bar rather than 
a double wishbone and a strut bar? If the strut bar is there then why go 
the double wishbone way?
##
What car are you saving for?
##
I did install these - the video will be up Saturday. I haven't installed 
the catback because I want to do engine upgrades differently - I want to 
prove they've made a difference, which requires dyno testing. I want to be 
able to tear apart my car and leave it in a garage, without needing it - 
which requires another car. This should all be solved within a year, as I'm 
saving for a new car currently. My channel grew a bit faster than I 
expected, so I'm just trying to keep up! 
##
Depending if you track it or not, perhaps. Basically you're just ensuring a 
bit more that the body stays as is. 
##
CAUSE I LOVE your videos so much i share a lot in my tweeter acount 
@salim77150
##
Hook up that Integra already lol
##
Well, it certainly shouldn't be very easy to bend it, but as you mentioned 
it's really only in tension/compression along the length of it. A vertical 
force wouldn't be applied, except possibly at the very ends. 
##
Thank you so much for explaining it, I've been trying to scratch my head 
over that particular part in my car even with research hardly many have 
good explanation over this. Also, does the size or weight of the bar effect 
its performance?
##
Do Caltrac bars, or or traction bars..I want to better understand how they 
work.
##
Front upper back strut bars + Lower front/back strut bars= awesome handling 
##
FIRST
##
Can you do a video on weight distribution and its significance on fwd awd 
rwd cars
##
Haha okay, I was like why do I want to go back in functionality? 
##
i would look into air suspension if you want it to be more comfortable. its 
expensive but i've heard it's worth it. 
##
Just another point to further reduce flexing. 
##
can you do a covertable stability vs cars with roofs stability and why 
convertibles aren't as stabile ?
##
Any idea about the reasoning about different mounting points for the shock 
tower bars on the integra/civic? I've been using the OEM Type R bar which 
mounts with those rubber gormets with the use of screws and nuts, whereas 
the gsr and type r have welded studs. I saw in the other video the bar you 
are using mounts on the shock mounts. And then there is the neuspeed bar 
which mounts over the upper control arm bolts. I honestl'y didnt feel any 
difference, but did read neuspeeds made the most. 
##
What about different types of strut bars? The one in your video is made of 
multiple pieces, while some cars use a single piece of metal.
##
A sway bar is a metal rod that attaches to the wheels at the hub using a 
link. The front/rear wheels are linked together in this way to when one 
wheel goes up when going over something it has to try and lift the other 
wheel with it. This is to reduce body roll or the side to side 
pitching/swaying you get after hitting a bump in some cars.
##
you will annoy people more then gain hp. If you want to gain hp you will 
have to re-do your exhaust system from the header's down. You can also swap 
out your tires for more racing ones. They warm up pretty fast and get 
sticky for max grip. I would go with tires if your ride is not turbo 
charged.
##
i thought that i new cars until i found you website, thnx man
##
In your vids, you say that the body of the car absorbs the the forces only 
in McPherson system. This is a little confusing. Since the springs are 
attached to the body, it has to absorbs the weight. I think you mean that a 
McPherson suspension transfers both rotational and linear movement. 
##
so can v say that adding a strut bar will reduce the dynamic camber gain 
during cornering???
##
Hey, not bad! I'm pretty proud of the Torsen differential drawings.
##
Is that an RSX?
##
It is possible, depending on how flexible the chassis/body is. 
##
Nope, check out my FAQs (link on my "About" page) for more info. 
##
yus please!
##
This may seem like a dumb question, but what's the best way to install a 
strut bar? Should the car be flat on the ground, all the way of the ground, 
or just slightly off the ground so there's little load on the suspension? 
Or does it even matter? Love your videos!
##
Water is cannot be compressed, so if you have water in a cylinder and it 
attempts to compress, it will fail to do so. This likely results in a 
broken connecting rod, and could cause other damage as well. 
##
Thank you, glad you enjoy the videos!
##
It's not that coveted of an accomplishment haha
##
Many companies do it quite differently - I'm not sure of what's ideal. But 
I do want to get a few videos out eventually on weight transfer and roll 
centers. 
##
Mechanical engineer. 
##
Explain c pillar bar and lower tie bar plz
##
I wouldn't say there would be a correlation, unless the strut is 
unnaturally strained from bending too much - though I'm skeptical that this 
would happen. 
##
Anti-roll bars connect independent suspension set-ups (at the control 
arms), so that when one wheel travels up, it causes the other to have a 
vertical force as well. 
##
Stock components in my 08 Impreza WRX are too soft and can't take corners. 
Would stiffer springs up the handling or does it only lower the ride?
##
You're welcome! Thanks for watching.
##
Best springs i've ever seen drawn by hands :D
##
all u need now is an intro for all ur videos! haha
##
And what's a sway bar?
##
OMG I GOT FIRST
##
Thanks, Ian. :)
##
frame O.o
##
This is my faviorate channel of all times, thanks for a great exlpaination
##
ah sorry typo, OBD2** and im sure you know why :)
##
great video man! p.s - i think that might be the best drawing youve done so 
far hah xD
##
Jason help me. lowered it with Eibach sport line, did my alignment 3 times 
since, but my car still drift to the right a lil bit.... let me know if u 
want the spec after the alignment. Thx! Max
##
true......they are damn aluminum and so thin...solid ones are the best
##
why use a strut bar instead of high performance springs/shock absorbers and 
a anti roll bars/ sway bars?
##
What you were holding in your hands is not a strut - it's garbage that does 
nothing; only solid bars like DC Sports really work
